The Satipatthana Vipassana 
Meditation 

A Basic Buddhist Mindfulness Excercise 





The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw, 
Bhadanta Sobhana Mahathera, Aggamahapandita. 












http://www.dhammadownload.com 


INTRODUCTION 

Satipatthana or the practice of mindfulness was recommended by the 
Buddha for all who seek to grow spiritually and eventually attain the real¬ 
ization of enlightenment. Buddhism itself is essentially a practical path, 
a system of physical and psychological techniques designed to bring about 
this realization. The method here described in this little book by the Vener¬ 
able MahasI Sayadaw, Bhadanta Sobhana Mahathera, Aggamahapandita, 
the spiritual head of Sasana Yeiktha Meditation Centre, Rangoon, is the 
foundation of all Buddhist meditation practice. This form of meditation 
may be practised with benefit by all, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, 
because its aim is simply to expand the practiser’s consciousness and bring 
him face to face with his mind. 

Buddhist psychology or Abhidhamma teaches that you are not your mind. 
You already know that you are not your body. But you do not yet know 
that you are not your mind, because normally you identify yourself with 
each thought, feeling, impulse, emotion or sensation that comes into your 
mind. Each takes you on a little trip. Through the practice of mindful¬ 
ness, you come to observe the rise and fall, the appearance and disappearance 
of these various thoughts and feelings, and gradually develop a sense of 
distance and detachment from them. Then you will no longer become 
caught up by your hangups. This leads to a deep inner peaceful calm. 
Through further practice, you will develop insight and wisdom, which is the 
power of consciousness to pierce through the veils of illusion and ignorance 
to the reality that lies beyond. 

At the instance of the former Prime Minister of the Union of Burma and 
of the President of the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Association of Rangoon, 
the Venerable MahasI Sayadaw came down from Shwebo to Rangoon on the 
10th November 1949. The Meditation Centre at the Thathana Yeiktha, 
Hermitage road, Rangoon, was formally opened on the 4th December 1949 
when the MahasI Sayadaw began to give to twenty-five devotees a methodi¬ 
cal training in the right system of Satipatthana Vipassana (Insight Meditation 
through Mindfulness). 

From the first day of the opening of the Centre, a discourse on the exposi¬ 
tion of the Satipatthana Vipassana, its purpose, the method of practice, the 
benefits derived therefrom, etc., has been given daily to each batch of devo¬ 
tees arriving at the Centre almost every day to undertake the intensive 
course of training. The discourse lasts normally for one hour and thirty 
minutes, and the task of talking almost daily in this manner had inevitably 
caused a strain. Fortunately the Buddha Sasana-nuggaha Association came 
forward to relieve the situation with an offer of charity or a tape recorder 
machine with which the discourse given on the 27th July 1951 to a group of 
fifteen devotees undertaking the training was taken on tape. Thereafter 
this tape recorded discourse has been in constant use daily, preceded by a 
few preliminary remarks spoken by the MahasI Sayadaw in person.

Then owing to the great demand of many branch Meditation Centres 
of the MahasI Satipa(thana Vipassana as well as of the public, this dis¬ 
course was published in book form in 1954. This book has now run to 
several editions. As there was also a keen interest and eager demand among 
many devotees of other nationalities who are unacquainted with Burmese, 
the discourse was translated into English by the late U Pe Thin, a lay dis¬ 
ciple and practised MahasI yogi, who had acted as interpreter to British 
Rear Admiral Shattock who went through a course of Vipassana meditation 
practice at the Centre in its early days. 

Explanatory Note on certain technical Buddhist terms 

Dhamma (Sanskrit Dharma) may mean (1) the doctrine of the Buddha, 
(2) the Truth, (3) the Ultimate Reality, (4) the correct conduct of life, (5) the 
ultimate psychic events which combine to form the content of consciousness. 

ftana may mean Gnosis or higher spiritual knowledge and illumination, 
or could signify an individual cognition of this type. 

Samadhi may mean (1) ordinary attention, (2) concentration of mind 
so it becomes one-pointed, (3) ecstatic trance, (4) a general name for all the 
various practices of mindfulness and meditation. 

The aim of Buddhist psychology (known as Abhidhamma) is to show that 
the mind is in reality an impersonal process composed of a large number 
of elementary psychic events called dhammas. 

Through mindful observation one comes to realize that there is no per¬ 
manent abiding entity called a self or ego in the Khandhas( Sanskrit Skandhas) 
(the five aggregates of human existence). The result of this realization is a 
detachment from the sensations, feelings, thoughts, ideas, impulses, etc, 
which are continually arising in the mind. The insight into this and full 
realization of it, is known as Panna (Sanskrit Prajna) or wisdom.

Namo Buddhassa 

Honour to the Fully Enlightened One 

On coming across the Teachings (sasana) of Lord Buddha it is 
most important for every one to cultivate in oneself the virtues of 
Morality, Concentration and Wisdom (sila, samadhi, and panna). One 
should, undoubtedly, possess these three virtues. 

Morality (sila) is the observance, by lay-people, of five precepts as 
a minimum measure. For monks it is the discipline of the Rules of 
Conduct for Monks (patimokkha sila). Any one who is 
well-disciplined in Morality would be reborn in the happy existence 
of human beings or devas. But. this ordinary form of Ordinary 
Morality (lokiya sila) would not be a safeguard against the relapse 
into the lower states of miserable existence, such as hell, or animals 
or Hungry Ghosts (petas). It is, therefore, desirable to cultivate the 
higher form of Supramundane Morality (lokuttara sila) as well. This 
is Path and Fruition Morality (magga and phala sila). When one has 
fully acquired the virtue of this Morality he is saved from the relapse 
into the lower states, and he will always lead a happy life by being 
reborn as human beings or Angels (devas). Everyone should, 
therefore, make it a point of his duty to work for the Supramundane 
Morality. There is every hope of success for anyone who works 
sincerely and in real earnest. It would indeed be a pity if anyone 
were to fail to take advantage of this fine chance of being endowed 
with the higher qualities, for he would undoubtedly be a victim 
sooner or later of his own bad Karma which would pull him down to 
lower states of miserable existence of hell, or animals or petas, where 
the span of life lasts for many hundreds, thousands or millions of 
million years. It is therefore emphasized here that this coming across 
the Teachings of Lord Buddha is the very opportunity for working 
for the Path and Fruition Morality. 

It is not feasible to work for the Morality alone. It is also 
necessary to practice Concentration (samadhi). Concentration is the 
fixed or tranquil state of mind. The ordinary or undisciplined mind is 
in the habit of wandering to other places; it cannot be kept under 
control; it follows any idea, thought or imagination, etc. In order to 


1 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


prevent its wandering, the mind should be made to attend repeatedly 
to a selected object of Concentration. On gaining practice the mind 
gradually loosens its traits and remains fixed on the object to which 
it is directed. This is Concentration. There are two forms of 
Concentration, viz, Ordinary Concentration and Supramundane 
Concentration. Of these two, the practice in the Meditational 
Development of Peaceful Calm (samatha bhavana) viz: Mindful 
Breathing, Meditation on Friendliness, Meditational Devices 
(anapana, metta, kasina) will enable the development of the states of 
Ordinary Absorption (lokiya jhana) such as four Form Absorptions 
(rupa-jhanas) and four Formlessness Absorptions (arupa-jhanas), by 
virtue of which one would be reborn in the plane of Brahma. The life 
span of Brahma is very long and lasts for one world cycle, two, four, 
eight up to a limit of eighty-four thousands of world-cycles as the 
case may be. But at the end of the lifespan a Brahma will die and be 
reborn as human being or angel. If he leads a virtuous life all the time 
he may lead a happy life in higher existence. But as he is not free 
from Defilements (kilesas) he may commit demeritorious deeds on 
many occasions. He will then be a victim of his bad Karma and will 
be reborn in hell or other lower states of miserable existence. This 
Ordinary Absorption also is not a definite security. It is desirable to 
work for the Supramundane Concentration, which is nothing but 
Path and Fruition Concentration (magga samadhi and phala 
samadhi). To possess this Concentration is is essential to cultivate 
Wisdom. 

There are two forms of Wisdom, namely, Mundane and 
Supramundane. Today the knowledge of literature, art, science or 
worldly affairs is usually regarded as a kind of Wisdom. But this form 
of Wisdom has nothing to do with any kind of Meditational 
Development (bhavana). Nor can it be regarded as of real merit 
because many weapons of destruction are invented through these 
knowledges, which are always under the influence of greed, hatred 
and other evil motives. The real spirit of that which is Ordinary 
Wisdom (lokiya panna) on the other hand has only merits and no 
demerits of any kind. The knowledge in welfare organizations and 
relief works without causing any harm: learning to acquire the 


2 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


knowledge of the true meaning or sense of the scriptures, and the 
three classes of knowledge in Insight Meditation (vipassana bhavana), 
such as, Wisdom Which Consists of Learning 
(suta-maya-panna)—knowledge based on learning; Wisdom Which 
Consists of Reflective Thinking (cinta- maya-panna)-knowledge 
based on thinking; and Wisdom Which Consists of Meditational 
Development (bhavana-maya- panna)—knowledge based on mental 
development, are Ordinary Wisdom (lokiya panna). The virtue of 
possessing Ordinary Wisdom would lead to a happy life in higher 
states of existence, but it cannot prevent the risk of being reborn in 
hell or other lower states of miserable existence. Only the 
development of Supramundane Wisdom can decidedly remove this 
risk. 

The Supramundane Wisdom is Path and Fruition. To develop this 
Wisdom it is necessary to carry on the practice of Meditational 
Development of Insight (vipassana bhavana) out of the three forms 
of discipline in cultivating Morality, Concentration and Wisdom. 
When the virtue of Wisdom is duly developed, the necessary qualities 
of Morality and Concentration are also acquired. 

The method of developing this Wisdom is to observe matter and 
mind which are the two sole elements existing in a body with a view 
to know them in their true form. At present times experiments in the 
analytical observation of matter are usually carried out in 
laboratories with the aid of various kinds of instruments; yet these 
methods cannot deal with mindstuff. The method of Lord Buddha 
does not, however, require any kind of instruments or outside aid. It 
can successfully deal with both matter and mind. It makes use of 
one’s own mind for analytical purpose by fixing bare attention on 
the activities of matter and mind as they occur in the body. By 
continually repeating this form of exercise the necessary 
Concentration can be gained and when the Concentration is keen 
enough, the ceaseless course of arising and passing away of matter 
and mind will be vividly perceptible. 

The body consists solely of the two distinct groups of matter and 
mind. The solid substance of body as it is now found belongs to the 
former group of matter. According to the usual enumeration in the 


3 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


terms of Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Eye, Form (pathavi, apo, tejo, vavo, 
cakkhu, rupa), there are altogether twenty-eight kinds in this group 
but in short it may be noted that the body is a mass of matter. For 
instance it is just like a doll made of clay or wheat which is nothing 
but a collection of clay dust or wheat powder. Matter changes its 
form under physical conditions of heat, cold, etc., and because of 
this fact of changeableness under contrary physical conditions it is 
called Form (rupa). It does not possess any faculty of knowing an 
object. 

In the Abhidhamma, the proper name for the third division of the 
Buddhist scriptures, deahng with the metaphysical and psychological, 
the elements of mind and matter are classified differently as Things 
Which Possess Consciousness and Things Which Lack Consciousness 
(sarammana dhamma and anarammana dhamma) respectively. The 
element of mind has an object, or holds an object, or knows an 
object while that of matter does not have an object, nor holds an 
object, nor knows an object. It will thus be seen that the 
Abhidhamma has directly stated that there is no faculty of knowing 
an object in the element of matter. A Yogi also perceives in like 
manner, that is, “material element has no faculty of knowing.” Logs 
and pillars, bricks and stones and lumps of earth are a mass of 
matter; they do not possess any faculty of knowing. It is the same 
case with material elements consisting in a living body; they have no 
faculty of knowing. The material elements in a dead body are like 
those of a living body; they are without the faculty of knowing. But 
people have a general idea that material elements of a living body 
possess the faculty of knowing an object irrespective of the fact 
whether it is in a dead or a living body. 

Then what is that which knows the objects now? It is the element 
of mind which comes into being depending on matter. It is called 
Mind (nama) because it inclines to an object. Mind is also spoken of 
as “thought” or “consciousness.” Mind .arises depending on matter as 
will be described hereafter. Depending on eye, eye- consciousness 
(seeing) arises; depending on ear, ear-consciousness (hearing) arises; 
depending on nose, nose- consciousness (smelling) arises; depending 
on tongue, tongue-consciousness (taste) arises; depending on body, 


4 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


body-consciousness (sense of touch) arises. There are many kinds, 
either good or bad, of the sense of touch. While it has a wide field of 
action by running throughout the whole length of body, inside and 
outside, the sense of sight, hearing, smell, or taste can on the other 
hand come into being respectively in its own particular sphere, such 
as eye, ear, nose, and tongue, which occupies a very small and limited 
space of the body. These senses of touch, sight, etc. are nothing but 
the elements of mind. Also there comes into being the 
mind-consciousness (i.e., thoughts, ideas, imaginations, etc.) 
depending on mind-base. All of these are elements of mind. Mind as a 
rule knows an object while matter does not know. 

People generally believe that, in the case of seeing, it is the eye 
which actually sees. They think that seeing and eye are one and the 
same thing. They also think, “Seeing is I: I see things: eye and seeing 
and I are one and the same person.” In actual fact this is not so. Eye 
is one thing and seeing is another and there is no separate entity such 
as “I” or “Ego.” There is only the fact of “seeing” coming into being 
depending on eye. 

To quote an example, it is like the case of a person who sits in a 
house. House and person are two separate things: House is not the 
person nor is person the house. Similarly it is so at the time of seeing. 
Eye and seeing are two separate things: eye is not seeing nor is seeing 
eye. 


To quote another example, it is just like the case of a person in a 
room who sees many things when he opens the window and looks 
through it. If it be asked, “Who is it that sees? Is it window or person 
that actuallly sees?” The answer is, ‘The window has no ability to 
see; it is only the person who sees.” If it be asked again, “Will the 
person be able to see things on the outside without the window?” 
then the answer will be, “It will not be possible to see things through 
the walling without the window; one can only see through the 


5

window.” Similarly, in the case of seeing there are two separate 
things of eye and seeing: eye is not seeing nor is seeing the eye. Yet 
there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In fact seeing 
comes into being depending on eye. It is now evident that in the 
body there are only two distinctive elements of matter (eye) and 
mind (seeing) at every moment of seeing. In addition there is also a 
third element of matter (visual object). At times the visual object is 
noticeable outside the body. If the last one is added there will be 
three elements, two of which (eye and visual object) are material and 
the third of which (seeing) is mental. Eye and visual object being 
material elements do not possess any ability of knowing an object, 
while seeing being a mental element can know the visual object and 
what it looks like. Now it is clear that there exist only two separate 
elements of matter and mind at the moment, and the arising of this 
pair of two separate elements is known as “seeing.” 

People who are without the training and knowledge of the 
Meditational Development of Insight (vipassana bhavana) hold the 
view that seeing belongs to or is “self, or ego, or living entity, or 
person.” They believe that “Seeing is I; or I am seeing; or 1 am 
knowing.” This kind of view or belief is called the Erroneous View 
That There is a Self (sakkaya-ditthi). Sakkaya means the group of 
matter (rupa) and mind (nama ) as they exist distinctively. Ditthi 
means to hold a wrong view of belief. The compound word of 
Sakkaya-ditthi means to hold a wrong view or belief on the dual set 
of Matter and Mind which are in real existence. For more clarity it 
will be explained further as to the manner of holding the wrong view 
or belief. At the moment of seeing, the things that are in actual 
existence are the eye and visual object of material group, and the 
seeing which belongs to mental group. These two kinds are in actual 
existence. Yet people hold the view that this group of elements is 
“self, or ego, or living entity.” They consider that “seeing is I; or 
what is seen is I; or I see my own body.” Thus this mistaken view is 
taken on the simple act of seeing as “self,” which is Sakkaya-ditthi. 

As long as one is not free from Sakkaya-ditthi one cannot expect 
to escape from the risk of falling into miserable existence of hell, or 
animals, or petas. Though he may be leading a happy life in the 


6 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


human or deva world by virtue of his merits, yet he is liable to fall 
back into the state of miserable life at any time when his demerits 
operate. For this reason Lord Buddha pointed out that it was 
essential to work for the total removal of Sakkaya-ditthi as follows: 

Sakkya ditthippahanaya sato bhikkhu paribbaje. 

This says: Though it is the wish of everyone to avoid old age, 
disease and death, yet no one can help it but must inevitably submit 
to them one day. After death, rebirth follows. Rebirth in any state of 
existence does not depend on one’s own wish. It is not possible to 
avoid rebirth in the realm of hell, or animals, or petas by merely 
wishing for an escape. Rebirth takes place in any state of existence as 
the circumstances of one’s own deeds provide, and there is no choice 
at all. For these reasons, the Wheel of Rebirth (samsara) is very 
dreadful. Every effort should therefore be made to acquaint oneself 
with the miserable conditions of Samsara and then to work for an 
escape from this incessant cycle, and for the attainment of Nirvana. 
If an escape from Samsara as a whole is not possible for the present, 
an attempt should be made for an escape at least from the round of 
rebirth in the realm of hell, or animals, or petas. In this case it is 
necessary to work for the total removal from oneself of the 
erroneous view that there is a self, which.is the root-cause of rebirth 
in the miserable states. This erroneous view can only be destroyed 
completely by the Holy Path and its Fruition (ariya magga and 
phala), three virtues of Morality, Concentration and Wisdom. It is, 
therefore, imperative to work for the development of these virtues. 
How to work? That is, Sato: by means of noting or observing; 
Paribbaje: must go out from the jurisdiction of Defilement (kilesa). 
One should practice by constantly noting or observing every act of 
seeing, hearing, etc., which are the constituent physical and mental 
processes of the body, till one is freed from Sakkaya-ditthi. 

For these reasons advice is always given here to take up the 
practice of Vipassana Meditation. Now Yogis have come here for the 
purpose of practicing Vipassana Meditation, who may be able to 
complete the course of training and attain the Holy Path in a short 
time. Sakkya-ditthi will then be totally removed and security against 
the danger of rebirth in the realm of hell, or animals, or petas will be 
finally gained.

In this respect the exercise is simply to note or observe the 
existing elements in every act of seeing. It should be noted as 
“seeing, seeing,” on every act of seeing. (By the terms of note or 
observe or contemplate it means the act of keeping the mind fixedly 
on the object with a view to knowing clearly.) Because of this fact of 
keeping the mind fixedly by noting as “seeing, seeing,” at times a 
visual object is noticed, at times consciousness of seeing is noticed, or 
at times it is noticed as eye-base or as a place from which it sees. It 
will serve the purpose if one can notice distinctly any one of the 
three. If not, basing on this act of seeing there will arise the 
erroneous view of self which will view it in the form of a person or 
belonging to a person and in the sense of Permanence, Happiness and 
Selfhood (nicca, sukha and atta), which will arouse attachment and 
craving. The Defilements will in turn prompt deeds, and the deeds 
will bring forth rebirth of new existence. Thus the process of 
dependent origination operates and the vicious circle of Samsara 
revolves incessantly. In order to prevent this from the source of 
seeing, it is necessary to note as “seeing, seeing” on every occasion of 
seeing. 

Similarly, in the case of hearing, there are only two distinct 
elements of matter and mind. The sense of hearing arises depending 
on ear. While ear and sound are two elements of matter, the sense of 
hearing is an element of mind. In order to know clearly any one of 
these two kinds of matter and mind it should be noted as “hearing, 
hearing” on every occasion of hearing. So also it should be noted as 
“smelling, smelling” on every occasion of smelling, and as “knowing, 
knowing” on every occasion of knowing the taste. 

Similarly, it should be noted in the case of knowing or feeling the 
sensation of touch in the. body. There is a kind of material element 
known as Nerve Tissue (kaya-pasada) throughout the body which 
receives every impression of touch. Every kind of touch, either 
agreeable or disagreeable, usually comes in collision with Nerve 
Tissue and there arises a Touch Consciousness (kaya-vinnana) which 
feels or knows the touch on each occasion. It will now be seen that 
at every time of touching there are two elements of matter, viz, 
sense-organ and impression of touch, and one element of mind, viz, 


8 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


knowing of touch. In order to know these things distinctly at every 
time of touch the practice of noting as “touching, touching” has to 
be carried out. This merely refers to the common form of sensation 
of touch. There are special forms which accompany painful or 
disagreeable sensations, such as, to feel stiff or tired in the body or 
limbs, to feel hot, to feel pain, to feel numb, to feel ache, etc. 
Because Feeling (vedana) predominates in these cases, it should be 
noted as “feeling hot, feeling tired, painful, etc.” as the case may be. 

It may also be mentioned that there occur many sensations of 
touch in hands and legs, etc., on each occasion of bending, 
stretching, or moving. Because of mind wanting to move, stretch or 
bend, the material activities of moving, stretching, or bending, etc., 
occur in series. (It may not be possible to notice these incidents for 
the present. They can only be noticed after some time on gaining 
practice. It is mentioned here for the sake of Knowledge.) All 
activities in movements and in changing, etc., are done by these 
minds. When the mind wills to bend, there arises a series of inward 
movements of hand or leg; when the mind wills to stretch or move, 
there arises a series of outward movements or movements to and fro 
respectively. They disappear or are lost soon after they occur and at 
the very point of occurrence. (One will notice these incidents later 
on.) 

In every case of bending, stretching or other activities, there arises 
in the foremost a series of intending or willing minds, and on account 
of which there occur in the hands and legs a series of material 
activities, such as stiffening (or being hard), bending, stretching, or 
moving to and fro. These activities come up against other material 
elements, nerve tissue, and on every occasion of collision between 
material activities and sensitive qualities, there arises Touch 
Consciousness, which feels or knows the sensation of touch. It is. 
therefore, clear that material activities are the predominating factors 
in these cases. It is necessary to notice these predominating factors. 
If not, there will surely arise the wrong view of holding these 
activities in the sense of “I or I am bending, or I am stretching, or My 
hands, or My legs.” This practice of noting as “bending, stretching, 
moving” is being carried out for the purpose of removing such a 
wrong view.

As regards “thoughts, imaginations, etc.” it may be mentioned 
that depending on mind-base there arise a series of mental activities, 
such as thinking, imagining, etc., or to speak in a general sense, a 
series of mental activities arise depending on this body. In reality 
each case is a composition of matter and mind; mind-base or body is 
matter, while thinking, imagining, etc. are mind. In order to be able 
to notice matter and mind clearly, it should be noted as “thinking, 
imaginging, etc.” in each case. 

After having carried out the practice in the manner indicated 
above for a time, there may be an improvement in Concentration. 
One will notice that the mind no longer wanders about but remains 
fixedly on the object to which it is directed. At the same time the 
power of noticing has considerably developed. On every occasion of 
noting he notices only two processes of matter and mind. A dual set 
of object and mind, which makes note of the object, is thus coming 
into existence. 

Again on proceeding further with the practice of contemplation 
for some time, one notices that nothing remains permanent but 
everything is in a state of flux. New things arise each time: each of 
them is noted every time as it arises; it then vanishes. Immediately 
another arises, which is again noted and which then vanishes. Thus 
the process of arising and vanishing goes on, which clearly shows that 
nothing is permanent. One is therefore convinced that “things are 
not permanent” because it is noticed that they arise and vanish at 
every time of noting. This is Insight into impermanency 
(aniccanupassana-nana). 

Then one is also convinced that arising and vanishing are not 
desirable. This is Insight into Suffering (dukkhanupassana-nana). 
Besides, one usually experiences many painful sensations in the 
body, such as tiredness, feeling hot, painful, aching, and at the time 
of noting these sensations he generally feels that this body is a 
collection of sufferings. This is also Insight into Suffering. 

Then at every time of noting it is found that elements of matter 
and mind occur according to their respective nature and 
conditioning, and not according to one’s wish. One is therefore 


10 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


convinced that they are elements: they are not governable: they are 
not person or living entity. This is Insight into the Absence of a Self 
(anattanupassana-nana). 

On having fully acquired these knowledges of Impermanence, 
Suffering, Absence of Self (anicca, dukkha, anatta), the maturity of 
Spiritual Knowledge of the Path and Spiritual Knowledge of its 
Fruition (magga nana and phala nana) takes place and realization of 
Nirvana is won. By winning the realization of Nirvana in the first 
stage, one is freed from the round of rebirth in the unhappy life of 
lower existence. Everyone should, therefore, endeavor to reach the 
first stage as a minimum measure. 

It has already been explained that the actual method of practice 
in Vipassana Meditation is to note or to observe or to contemplate 
the successive occurrences of seeing, hearing, etc., at six points or 
sense doors. However, it will not be possible for a beginner to follow 
up all successive incidents as they occur because his Mindfulness, 
Concentration and Spiritual Knowledge (sati, samadhi and nana) are 
still very weak. The incidents of seeing, hearing, etc. occur very 
swiftly. Seeing seems to occur at the time of hearing; hearing seems 
to occlir at the time of seeing; it seems that both seeing and heaiing 
occur simultaneously. It seems that three or four incidents of seeing, 
hearing, thinking, and imagining usually occur simultaneously. It is 
not possible to distinguish which occurs first and which follows next 
because they occur so swiftly. In actual fact, seeing does not occur at 
the time of hearing nor does hearing occur at the time of seeing. 
Such incidents can occur one only at a time. A Yogi who has just 
begun the practice and who has not sufficiently developed 
Mindfulness, Concentration and Spiritual Knowledge will not, 
however, be in a position to observe all these incidents singly as they 
occur in serial order. A beginner need not therefore follow up many 
things, but should instead start with a few things. Seeing or hearing 
occurs only when due attention is given. If one does not pay heed to 
any sight or sound, one may pass the time mostly without any 
occasion of seeing or hearing. Smelling occurs rarely. Experience of 
taste occurs only at the time of eating. In the cases of seeing, hearing, 
smelling and tasting, the Yogi can note them when they occur. 


11

However, body impressions are ever present: they usually exist quite 
distinctly all the time. During the time that one is sitting, the body 
impressions of stiffness or the sensation of hardness in this position 
are distinctly felt. Attention should therefore be fixed on the sitting 
posture and a note made as “sitting, sitting, sitting.” 

Sitting is an erect posture of body consisting of a series of 
physical activities which are induced by the consciousness consisting 
of a series of mental activities. It is just like the case of an inflated 
rubber ball which maintains its round shape through the resistance of 
the air inside it: so is the posture of sitting, in which the body is kept 
in an erect posture through the continuous process of physical 
activities. A good deal of energy will be requir ed to pull up and keep 
in an erect position such a heavy load as this body. People generally 
assume that the body is lifted and kept in the position by means of 
sinews. This assumption is correct in a sense because sinews, blood, 
flesh, bones are nothing but material elements. The element of 
stiffening which keeps the body in an erect posture belongs to the 
material group and arises in the sinews, flesh, blood, etc. throughout 
the body like the air in a rubber ball. The element of stiffening is 
vayo-dhatu, the air element. The body is kept in the erect position 
by the presence of the Air Element in the form of stiffening, which is 
continually coming into existence. At the time of heavy drowsiness 
one may drop flat, because the supply of new materials in the form 
of stiffening is cut off. The state of mind in heavy drowsiness or 
sleep is Unconsciousness (bhavanga). During the course of 
Unconsciousness mental activities are absent, and for this reason the 
body lies flat during sleep or heavy drowsiness. During waking hours 
strong and active mental activities are continually arising, and 
because of these there arises a series of Air Elements in the form of 
stiffening. In order to know these facts it is essential to note 
attentively as “sitting, sitting, sitting.” This does not necessarily 
mean that the body impressions of stiffening should be particularly 
searched and noted. Attention need only be fixed on the whole form 
of sitting posture, that is, the lower portion in a bending circular 
form and the upper portion in an erect posture. 

It will be found that the exercise of observing a single object of 


12 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


sitting posture is too easy and does not require much effort. In the 
circumstances Vigor (viriya) is less and Concentration is in excess, 
and one would generally feel lazy to carry on the noting as “sitting, 
sitting, sitting,” repeatedly for a considerable time. Laziness 
generally occurs when there is excess of Concentration and less 
Vigor. It is nothing but a state of Torpor (thina-midha). More Vigor 
should be developed, and for this purpose the number of objects for 
noting should be increased. After noting as “sitting,” the attention 
should be directed to a spot in the body where the sense of touch is 
felt and a note made as “touching.” Any spot in the leg or hand or 
hip where a sense of touch is distinctly felt will serve the purpose. 

For example, after noting the sitting posture of the body as 
“sitting,” the spot where the sense of touch is felt should be noted as 
“touching.” The noting should thus be repeated on these two objects 
of sitting posture and the place of touching alternately, as “sitting, 
touching; sitting, touching; sitting, touching.” 

The terms noting or observing or contemplating are used here to 
indicate the fixing of attention on an object. The exercise is simply 
to note or observe or contemplate as “sitting, touching.” Those who 
already have experience in the practice of meditation may perhaps 
find this exercise easy to begin with, but those without any previous 
experience may find it rather difficult to begin with. 

The more simplified and easy form of exercise for a beginner is 
this: At every time of breathing there occur movements in the form 
of rising and falling of one’s abdomen. A beginner should start with 
this exercise of noting or observing these movements. It is easy to 
observe these movements because they are coarse and prominent and 
are more suitable for a beginner. As in schools where simple lessons 
are easy to learn so is the case in the practice of Vipassana 
Meditation. A beginner will find it easier to develop Concentration 
and Spiritual Knowledge with a simple and easy exercise. 

Again, the purpose of the Vipassana Meditation is to begin the 
exercise by contemplating prominent factors in the body. Of the two 
factors of mind and matter, the mental element is subtle and less 
prominent while the material element is coarse and more prominent. 


13 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


Therefore the usual procedure for one who practices the Vipassana 
insight meditation (vipassana-yanika) is to begin the exercise by 
contemplating the material elements at the outset. As regards 
material elements it may be mentioned here that Etheric Matter 
(upada-rupa) is subtle and less prominent while Dense Physical 
Matter (maha-buta), the four primary physical elements of Earth, 
Water, Fire and Air are coarse and more prominent and should 
therefore have the priority of being placed first in the order of 
objects for contemplation. In the case of rising and falling the 
outstanding factor is the Air Element. The process of stiffening and 
the movements of abdomen noticed during the contemplation are 
nothing but the functions of this element. Thus it will be seen that 
the Air Element is perceptible at the beginning. According to the 
instructions of Satipatthana Sutra, the discourse of the Buddha, 
dealing with the practice of mindfulness, one should be mindful of 
the activities of walking while walking, of those of standing, sitting, 
and lying down while standing, sitting, and lying down, respectively. 
One should also be mindful of other bodily activities as each of them 
occurs. In this connection it is stated in the commentaries that one 
should be mindful primarily of the Air Element in preference to the 
other three. As a matter of fact, all four elements of Dense Physical 
Matter are dominant in every action of the body, and it is essential to 
perceive any one of these. At the time of sitting, either of the two 
movements of rising and falling occurs conspicuously at every time 
of breathing, and a beginning should be made by noting one of these 
movements. 

Some fundamental features in the system of Vipassana Meditation 
have been explained for general information. The general outline of 
basic exercises will now be discussed. 

When contemplating rising and falling, the disciple should keep 
his mind on the abdomen. He will then come to know the upward 
movement (expansion) of the abdomen on inbreathing, and a 
downward movement (contraction) on outbreathing. A mental note 
should be made as “rising” for upward movement, and “falling” for 
downward movement. If these movements are not clearly noticed by 
merely fixing the mind, one or both hands should be placed on the 


14 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


abdomen. The disciple should not try to change the manner of his 
natural breathing:. he should neither attempt slow breathing by the 
retention of his breath, nor quick breathing nor deep breathing. If he 
does change the natural flow of his breathing he will soon tire 
himself. He must therefore keep to the natural breathing, and 
proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling. 

On the occurring of upward movement, a mental note calling it as 
“rising” should be made, and on the downward movement, a mental 
note calling it as “falling” should be made. The calling of these terms 
or names should not be repeated by mouth. In Vipassana Meditation 
it is more important to know the actual state of object than to know 
it by the term or name. It is therefore necessary for the disciple to 
make every effort to be mindful of the movement of rising from the 
beginning till the end and that of falling from the start to the finish, 
as if these movements are actually seen by the eyes. As soon as rising 
occurs, there should be the knowing mind close to the movement. As 
in the case of a stone hitting the wall, the movement of rising as it 
occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every 
occasion. Similarly the movement of falling as it occurs and the mind 
knowing it must come together on every occasion. 

When there is no object of special outstanding nature, the disciple 
should carry on the exercise of noting these two movements as 
“rising, falling; rising, falling; rising, falling.” While thus being 
occupied with this exercise, there may be occasions when the mind 
wanders about. When the Concentration is weak it is very difficult to 
control the mind. Though it is directed to the movements of rising 
and falling the mind will not stay with them but will wander to other 
places. This wandering mind should not be let alone: it should be 
noted as “wandering, wandering” as soon as it goes out. On noting 
repeatedly once or twice when the mind stops wandering, then the 
exercise of noting as “rising, falling” should be continued. When it is 
found again that the mind has reached a place it should be noted as 
“reaching, reaching.” Then the exercise of noting as “rising, falling” 
should be reverted to as soon as these movements are clear. On 
meeting with a person in the imagination it should be noted as 
“meeting, meeting,” and after which the usual exercise should be 


15 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


reverted to. Some time the fact that it is a mere imagination is found 
out at the time of speaking with an imaginary person, and it should 
be noted as “speaking, speaking.” The real purpose is to note every 
mental activity as it occurs. For instance, it should be noted as 
“thinking, thinking” at the moment of thinking, and as “reflecting, 
planning, knowing, attending, rejoicing, feeling lazy, feeling happy, 
disgusting, etc.” as the case may be on the occurrence of each 
activity. The contemplation of mental activities and noticing them as 
they occur is called Cittanupassana. 

Because they have no practical knowledge in Vipassana 
Meditation people are generally not in a position to know the real 
state of the mind. This naturally leads them to the wrong view of 
holding mind as Person, self or living entity. They usually believe 
that “Imagination is I: I am imagining: I am thinking: I am planning: 
I am knowing, and so forth.” They consider that there exists a living 
entity or self which grows up from childhood to the age of manhood. 
In reality there does not exist a living entity, but there does exist a 
continuous process of elements of mind which occurs singly at a time 
and in succession. The practice of contemplation is therefore being 
carried out with a view to find out the actual fact. 

As regards mind and the manner of its arising, Buddha stated in 
The Dhammapada the following: 

Duran-gam am Eka-caram, A-sariram Guha-sayam. 

Ye Cittam Samyamessanti, Mokkhanti Mara-bandhana. 

Duran-gaman—Used to go to far-off objects. 

Mind usually wanders far and wide. While the Yogi is trying to 
carry on with the practice of contemplation in his meditation cell he 
often finds out that his mind usually wanders to many far-off places, 
towns, etc. He also finds that the mind can wander to any far-off 
places which have been known previously at the very moment of 
thinking or imagining. This fact should be found out with the help of 
contemplation. 

Eka-caram—Usually occurs singly. 

Mind usually occurs singly and one after another in succession. 
Those, who do not perceive this fact, believe that one mind exists in 


16 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


the course of life or existence. They do not know that new minds 
(thought forms) are always arising at every moment. They think that 
seeing, hearing, etc. of the past and those of the present belong to 
one and the same mind, and that three or four acts of seeing, hearing, 
touching, knowing usually occur simultaneously. These are wrong 
views. In actual fact, a single new mind arises at every moment. This 
can be perceived on gaining considerable practice. The cases of 
imagination and planning are clearly perceptible. Imagination 
vanishes as soon as it is noted as “imagining, imagining,” and 
planning also vanishes as soon as it is noted as “planning, planning.” 
These instances of arising, noting, and vanishing appear like a string 
of beads. The preceding mind is not the following mind. Each is 
separate. These facts are perceivable personally, and for this purpose 
one must proceed with the contemplation. 

A-sariram—Incorporeal. 

Mind has no substance and no form. It is not easy to distinguish it 
as with matter. In the case of matter the structure of body, head, 
hands and legs is very prominent and easily noticed. If it is asked 
what is matter it can be handled and shown. As for mind it is not 
easy to describe, because it has no substance and no form. For this 
reason it is not possible to carry out laboratory analytical 
experiments of mind. However, one could fully understand if it is 
explained that the knowing of an object is mind. To understand the 
mind minutely it is essential to contemplate the mind at every time 
of its occurring. When the contemplation is fairly advanced the 
mind’s approach to its object is clearly comprehended. It appears as 
if each is making a direct leap towards its object. In order to know 
the true manner of mind the contemplation is thus prescribed. 

Guha-sayam-Stays in the cave. 

Because this mind usually comes into existence depending on 
mindbase and other sense doors situated in the body, it is said that it 
stays in the cave. 

Ye Cittam Samyamessanti, Mokkhanti Mara-band harm—If the 
Yogi could restrain this mind he would be freed from the bondage of 
Death. 


17 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


It is said that the mind should be contemplated each time as it 
occurs: mind can thus be controlled by means of contemplation. On 
his successfully controlling the mind the Yogi would win freedom 
from the bondage of Death. It will be seen now that it is important 
to note the mind at every occurrence. As soon as it is noted mind 
usually vanishes. For instance,.by noting once or twice as “intending, 
intending” it is found that intention disappears at once. Then the 
usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling; rising, falling,” should be 
reverted to. 

During the time of proceeding with the usual exercise, one may 
feel wanting to swallow saliva. It should be noted as “wanting” and 
on gathering saliva as “gathering,” and on swallowing as 
“swallowing” in the serial order of occurrences. The reason for 
contemplating in this case is because there may be a persisting 
personal view as “wanting to swallow is I: swallowing is also I.” In 
actual fact, “wanting to swallow” is mind and not I and 
“swallowing” is matter and not I. There exists only mind and matter 
at that time. By means of contemplation in this manner one will 
understand clearly the process of actual facts. So also in the case of 
spitting it should be noted as “wanting” when one wants to spit, as 
“bending” on bending the neck (which should be done slowly), as 
“looking, seeing” on looking and as “spitting” on spitting. 
Afterwards, the usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling” should be 
proceeded with. 

Because of the fact of sitting for a long time there will arise in the 
body unpleasant feelings of being stiff, being hot and so forth. These 
sensations should be noted as they occur. Mind should be fixed on 
the spot and a note made as “stiff, stiff” on feeling stiff, as “hot, 
hot” on feeling hot, as “painful, painful” on feeling painful, and 
“prickly, prickly” on feeling a prickly sensation, and as “tired, tired” 
on feeling tired. These unpleasant feelings are Feelings of Pain 
(dukklia vedana) and the contemplation of these feelings is Insight 
Into Feeling (vedana-nupassana). 

Owing to the absence of knowledge in Insight Into Feeling, there 
used to prevail a wrong view of holding them as one’s own 
personality or self, that is to say, “I am feeling stiff: I am feeling hot: 


18 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


I am feeling painful: I was feeling well formerly but now I feel 
uncomfortable” in the manner of a single self. In real fact unpleasant 
feelings arise owing to disagreeable impressions in the body. Like the 
light of an electric bulb which can continue to burn on the 
continuous supply of energy so is the case of feelings, which arise 
anew in series on every occasion of coming in contact with 
disagreeable impressions. 

It is essential to understand these feelings clearly. At the 
beginning of noting as “stiff, stiff: hot, hot; painful, painful” he may 
feel that such disagreeable feeling grows stronger, and then he will 
notice that the mind wanting to change the posture arises. This mind 
should be noted as “wanting, wanting.” Then a return should be 
made to the feeling and noted as “stiff, stiff,” or “hot, hot,” and so 
forth. If the contemplation is continued with great patience in this 
manner, such unpleasant feelings will pass away. 

There is a saying, “Patience leads to Nirvana.” Evidently this 
saying is more applicable in this case of contemplation than in any 
other case. Plenty of patience is needed in contemplation. If a Yogi 
cannot bear unpleasant feelings with patience but frequently changes 
his posture during contemplation, he cannot expect to gain 
Concentration. Without Concentration there is no chance of 
acquiring Spiritual Knowledge of Insight (vipassana-nana). Without 
this, the attainment of Path, Fruition, and Nirvana cannot be won. 
Patience is of great importance in contemplation. Patience is mostly 
needed to bear up unpleasant feelings. This means the observance of 
the Cultivation of Patience (khan tisa invar a) discipline. He should not 
therefore change his posture immediately when he feels unpleasant 
sensations but must proceed with noting them as “stiff, stiff; hot, 
hot” and so on. Such normal painful sensations will ordinarily pass 
away. In the case of strong Concentration it will be found that even 
great pains will pass away when they are being noted with patience. 
On the fading away of suffering or pain the usual exercise should be 
reverted to and noting carried out as “rising, falling; rising, falling.” 

On the other hand it may be found that pains or unpleasant 
feelings do not pass away in spite of making a note with great 
patience. In such a case it cannot be helped but to change the 


19

posture. One must, of course, submit to superior forces. When 
Concentration is not strong enough pains will not pass away soon. In 
these circumstances there will often arise a mind wanting to change 
the posture, and this mind should be noted as “wanting, wanting,” 
after which it should be continued to note as “lifting, lifting” on 
lifting the hand; as “moving, moving” on moving it forward. These 
bodily actions should be carried out slowly, and these slow 
movements should be followed up and noted as “lifting, lifting; 
moving, moving; touching, touching” in the successive order of 
processes. Again on swaying the body a note should be made as 
“swaying, swaying”; on raising the leg as “raising, raising”; on 
moving as “moving, moving”; and on putting down as “putting, 
putting.” If then there is nothing to do, it should be reverted to the 
usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling; rising, falling.” There 
should be no stop or break in between. The preceding act of noting 
and the one which follows should be contiguous. Similarly the 
preceding Concentration and the one which follows should be 
contiguous, and the preceding Spiritual Knowledge (nana) and the 
one which follows should be contiguous. In this way the gradual 
development, by stages, of Mindfulness, Concentration and Spiritual 
Knowledge takes place, and depending on their full development the 
final stage of Spiritual Knowledge of the Path (magga-nana) is 
attained. 

In the practice of Vipassana Meditation it is important to follow 
the example of a person who tries to make a fire. In olden days a 
person had to work without stopping by rubbing two dry sticks till 
fire was produced. As the sticks got hotter and hotter, the more 
effort was needed, and rubbing had to be carried out incessantly. 
Only when the fire was produced was he then at liberty to take rest. 
Similarly a Yogi should work hard so that there may not be any 
break between the preceding noting and the one which follows, and 
the preceding Concentration and the one which follows. He should 
revert to his usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling” when he has 
noted the painful sensations. 

While being thus occupied with his usual exercise, he may again 
feel the itching sensation somewhere in the body. He should then fix 


20 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


his mind on the spot and make a note as “itching, itching.” Itching is 
an unpleasant sensation. As soon as it is felt there arises a mind 
wanting to rub or scratch. This mind should be noted as “wanting, 
wanting” after which no rubbing must be done as yet but a return 
must be made to itching and a note made as “itching, itching.” While 
occupied with contemplation in this manner, itching used to 
disappear in most cases. Then the usual exercise of noting as “rising, 
falling” should be reverted to. If on the other hand it is found that 
itching does not disappear but it is necessary to rub or scratch, the 
contemplation of the successive processes should be carried out by 
noting the mind as “wanting, wanting.” It should then be continued 
by noting as “raising, raising,” on raising the hand; as “moving, 
moving” on moving the hand; as “touching, touching” when the 
hand touches the spot; as “rubbing, rubbing” or “scratching, 
scratching” when the hand rubs or scratches; as “withdrawing, 
withdrawing” on withdrawing the hand; as “touching, knowing” 
when the hand touches the body; and then afterwards contemplation 
should be reverted to the usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling.” 
In every case of changing the postures of contemplation of the 
successive processes should be carried out similarly and carefully. 

While thus carefully proceeding with the contemplation it is 
found that painful feelings or unpleasant sensations arise in the body 
of their own accord. Ordinarily people used to change the posture as 
soon as they feel even the slight unpleasant sensation of tiredness or 
feeling hot without taking heed of these incidents. The change is 
carried out quite heedlessly just while the seed of pain is beginning to 
grow. Thus painful feelings fail to take place in a distinctive manner. 
For this reason it is said that Posture (iriya-patha), as a rule, hides the 
painful feelings from view. People generally think that they are 
feeling well for days and nights. They consider that painful feelings 
occur at the time of an attack of a dangerous disease. 

The fact is just the contrast of what people think. Let anyone try 
and see how long he can keep himself in a sitting posture without 
moving or changing. He will Find it uncomfortable after a short 
while, say five or ten minutes, and then he will find it unbearable 
after fifteen or twenty minutes. He will then be compelled to move 


21 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


or change the posture, by either raising or lowering his head, moving 
the hands or legs by swaying his body either forward or backward. 
Many movements usually take place during a short time and the 
number would be very large if they are to be counted for a day. 
However, no one appears to be aware of these facts because no one 
takes heed of them. Such is the order in every case. While in the case 
of a Yogi who is always mindful of his actions and is proceeding with 
contemplation, body impressions in their own respective nature are 
therefore distinctly noticed. They cannot help but reveal themselves 
fully in their own nature because he is watching until they come to 
the full view. Though a painful sensation arises he keeps on noting it: 
he does not ordinarily attempt to change or move. Then on the 
arising of mind wanting to change he at once makes a note of it as 
“wanting, wanting” and afterwards he returns again to the painful 
sensation and continues his noting of it. He changes or moves only 
when he finds the pain unbearable. In this case also he begins by 
noting the wanting mind and proceeds with noting carefully every 
action jn the process of moving. This is why Posture can no longer 
hide painful sensation. Often a Yogi feels painful sensations creeping 
from here and there or he may feel a hot sensation, aching sensation, 
itching, or he may feel that the whole body is a mass of painful 
sensation. That is how painful sensations are found to be 
predominating because Posture cannot cover them. 

If he intends to change the posture from sitting to standing, he 
should in the first place make a note of the intending mind as 
“intending, intending” and proceed with the acts of arranging the 
hands and legs in the successive order by noting, “raising, moving, 
stretching, touching, pressing, and so forth.” When the body sways 
forward it should be noted as “swaying, swaying.” While in the 
course oi standing up, rising, there occurs lightness in the body. 
Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as 
“rising, rising.” The act of rising up should be carried out slowly. 
During the course of practice it is most appropriate if a Yogi acts 
feebly and slowly in all his activities just like a weak sick person. 
Perhaps the case of a person suffering from lumbago would be a 
more fitting example here. The patient must be cautious and move 


22 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


slowly to avoid pains. In the same manner a Yogi should always try 
and keep to slow motions in all the actions. The lowest speed is 
necessary to enable Mindfulness, Concentration, and Spiritual 
Knowledge to catch up. One has lived all the time in a light-hearted 
manner, and he just begins seriously to train himself for keeping his 
mind in the body. It is the beginning only and Mindfulness and 
Spiritual Knowledge have not yet been properly geared up while the 
physical and mental processes are moving at top speed. It is therefore 
imperative to bring the top-level speed of these processes to the 
lowest gear so as to make it possible for the Mindfulness and 
Spiritual Knowledge to keep pace with them. It is therefore 
instructed that slow motion exercises should be carried out at all 
times. 

Further it may be mentioned that it is advisable for a Yogi to 
behave like a blind person throughout the course of training. A 
person without any restrained manner will not look dignified because 
he usually looks at things and persons wantonly. He cannot obtain a 
steady and calm state. While on the other hand the blind person 
behaves in a composed manner by sitting sedately with downcast 
eyes: he never turns to any direction to look at things or persons 
because he is blind and cannot see them. Even if a person comes near 
him and speaks to him he never turns around. This composed manner 
is worthy of imitation. A Yogi should act in the same manner while 
carrying out the contemplation: he should not look anywhere; his 
mind must be intent solely on the object of contemplation; while in 
the sitting posture he must be intently noting as “rising, falling." 
Even if strange things occur nearby, he must not look at them 
carefully: he must simply make a note as “seeing, seeing” and then 
pass on to the usual exercise by noting as "rising, falling." A Yogi 
should have a high regard for the exercise and carry it out with due 
respect so much so as to be mistaken for a blind person. 

In this respect certain female Yogis were found to be in perfect 
form. They carefully carried out the exercise with all due respect in 
accordance with the instructions. Their manner was very composed, 
and they were always intent on the objects of contemplation. They 
never looked around. When they walked they were always intent on 


23 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


the steps. Their steps were light, smooth and slow. Every Yogi should 
follow their example. 

It is necessary for a Yogi to behave like a deaf person also. 
Ordinarily a person, as soon as he hears a sound, turns around and 
looks at the direction from where the sound comes. Or he turns 
around towards the person who speaks to him and makes a reply. He 
will not behave in a sedate manner. While on the other hand, a deaf 
person behaves in a composed manner: he does not take heed of any 
sound or talk because he never hears them. Similarly a Yogi should 
conduct himself in like manner without taking heed of any 
unimportant talk nor should he deliberately listen to any talk or 
speech. If he happens to hear any sound or talk he should at once 
make a note as “hearing, hearing” and then return to the usual 
exercise of noting as “rising, falling.” He should proceed with his 
contemplation intently so much so as to be mistaken for a deaf 
person. 

It should be remembered that the carrying out intently of 
contemplation is the only concern of a Yogi; other things seen or 
heard are not his concern. He should not take heed of them even 
though they may appear to be strange or curious. When he sees any 
sights he must ignore them as if he does not see; so also in the case of 
voices or sounds he must ignore them as if he does not hear. In the 
case of bodily actions he must act slowly and feebly as if he were 
sick and very weak. 

It is therefore emphasized that the act of pulling up the body to 
the standing posture should be carried out slowly. On coming to an 
erect position a note should be made as “standing, standing”; if he 
happens to look around, a note should be made as “looking, seeing”; 
and on walking each step should be noted as “right step, left step” or 
“walking, walking.” In each step attention should be fixed on the 
movement from the point of lifting the leg to the point of putting 
down. While walking in quick steps or taking a long walk, a note on 
one section of each step as “right step, left step” or “walking, 
walking” will do. In the case of taking a slow walk, each step may be 
divided into three sections of lifting, pushing forward and putting 
down respectively. In the beginning of the exercise a note should be 


24 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


made on two sections in each step as “lifting,” by fixing the 
attention on the upward movement of the leg from the beginning to 
the end, and as “putting” on the downward movement from the 
beginning to the end. Thus the exercise which starts with the first 
step by noting as “lifting, putting” now ends. Here it may be 
mentioned that, at the time of noting as “putting” when the leg is 
put down in the first step, the other leg happens usually to lift up to 
begin the next step. This should not be allowed to happen. Next step 
should begin only after the end of the first step, such as “lifting, 
putting” for the first one and “lifting, putting” for the next step. 
After two or three days this exercise would be easy and he should 
carry out the exercise of noting each step in three sections as “lifting, 
pushing, putting.” For the present a Yogi should start the exercise by 
noting as “right step, left step,” or “walking, walking” while walking 
quickly, and by noting as “lifting, putting” while walking slowly. 

In the course of his walk he may feel wanting to sit down. He 
should then make a note as “wanting, wanting”; if he then happens 
to look up as “looking, seeing; looking, seeing”; on going to the place 
for sitting as “lifting, putting”; on stopping as “stopping, stopping”; 
on turning as “turning, turning”; when he feels wanting to sit as 
“wanting, wanting.” In the act of sitting there occurs a heaviness in 
the body and also a downward pull. Attention should be fixed on 
these factors and a note made as “sitting, sitting, sitting.” After 
having sat down there would be movements of bringing the hands 
and legs into position. They should be noted as “moving, bending, 
stretching, and so forth.” If there is nothing to do and if he is sitting 
quietly he should revert to the usual exercise of noting as “rising, 
falling.” 

If in the course of contemplation he feels painful or tired or hot 
he should make a note of them and then revert to the usual exercise 
by noting as “rising, falling.” If he feels sleepy he should make a note 
as “sleepy, sleepy,” and proceed with the noting of all acts of 
preparing for lying down and bringing into position the hands and 
legs as “raising, pressing, moving, supporting”; when the body sways 
as “swaying, swaying”; when the legs stretch as “stretching, 
stretching”; and when the body drops and lies flat as “lying, lying.” 


25 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


These trifling acts in lying down are also important and they 
should not be neglected. There is every possibility of attaining 
enlightenment during this short time. On the full development of 
Concentration and Spiritual Knowledge enlightenment is attainable 
during the present moment of bending or stretching. In this way 
Venerable Ananda (nephew and personal attendant of the Buddha) 
attained Arhatship at the very moment of lying down. 

About the beginning of the fourth month after the great final 
Nirvana after death (maha-parinirvana) of the Lord Buddha it was 
arranged to hold the first sangayana. By this term is meant the 
council of monks who collectively made classification, examination, 
confirmation and recitation of all teachings of Lord Buddha. At that 
time five hundred monks were chosen for the work. Of them four 
hundred and ninety-nine were Arhats (Adepts, who have become 
perfect and have attained enlightenment) while Venerable Ananda 
alone was a Sotapanna (Stream Winner, i.e., the first stage on the 
path when one has entered the stream leading to enlightenment). In 
order to attend the Council as an Arhat on the same level with the 
others he made his utmost effort to carry on with the meditation 
until just one day before the first day of the Council. That was on 
the fourth waning of the month of August. He proceeded with the 
contemplation of Mindfulness of the Body (kaya-gata-sati) which is 
also known as the Application of Mindfulness to Insight into the 
Functioning of the Body (kaya-nupassana satipatthana) and kept on 
walking the whole night. It might be in the same manner of. noting as 
“right step, left step” or “walking, walking.” He was thus occupied 
with the intent contemplation of mental and material processes in 
each step till the dawn of the next day. But he had not yet attained 
the Arhatship. 

Then the Venerable Ananda thought thus: “I have done my 
utmost. Lord Buddha used to say, ‘Ananda, you possess full 
Perfections (paramis). Do proceed with the practice of meditation. 
You will surely attain Arhatship one day.’ I have tried my level best 
so much that I can be counted as one of those who ever did their 
best in meditation. What may be the reason for my failure?” Then he 
remembered: “Ah! I was overzealous in keeping solely to the 


26 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


exercise of walking throughout the night. There was an excess of 
Vigor and less Concentration, which indeed was responsible for the 
state of Restlessness (uddhacca). It is now necessary to stop walking 
so as to bring Vigor in level with Concentration and to proceed with 
the contemplation in a lying position.” Venerable Ananda 
accordingly entered his room and sat down on the bench and then 
began to lie down. It was said that Venerable Ananda attained 
Arhatship thus at the moment of lying down or rather at the 
moment of contemplating as “lying, lying.” 

This manner of attaining Arhatship has been recorded as a strange 
event in the Commentaries because this manner was outside of the 
four regular postures of walking, standing, sitting and lying down. At 
that moment Venerable Ananda could not be regarded strictly to 
have been in a standing posture because his feet were off the floor, 
nor could he be regarded as sitting because his body was in a leaning 
position quite close to a pillow, nor in a laying posture because his 
head had not touched the pillow and the body did not lay flat as yet. 
As Venerable Ananda was a Stream Winner he had to develop 
through three other higher stages: the Path and Fruition of a 
Once-Returner, second stage on the Path; Path and Fruition of a 
Never-Retumer, third stage on the Path; and Path and Fruition of an 
Adept, fourth and final stage of the Path (sakadagami magga &amp; phala, 
anagami magga &amp; phala, arahatta magga &amp; phala) in his final 
attainment. It took a moment only. Every care is therefore needed to 
carry on the practice of contemplation without relaxation or 
omission. 

In the act of lying down, contemplation should be carried out 
with due care. When one feels sleepy and wants to lie down a note 
should be made as “sleepy, sleepy; wanting, wanting”; on raising the 
hand as “raising, raising”; on stretching as “stretching, stretching”; 
on touching as “touching, touching”; on pressing as “pressing, 
pressing”; after swaying the body and on dropping it down as “lying, 
lying.” The action of lying down should be carried out very slowly. 
On touching with the pillow it should be noted as “touching, 
touching”—there are many places of touch all over the body but each 
spot only need be noted at one time. In the lying position there are 


27 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


many bodily actions for bringing the legs and hands into position 
also. These actions should be noted carefully as “raising, stretching, 
bending, moving, and so on.” On turning the body a note should be 
made as “turning, turning” and when there is nothing particular the 
usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling” should be reverted to. 
When lying on the side or on the back there are usually no particular 
things to be noted: then the usual exercise must be reverted to. 

But there may be times when the mind wanders while one is in 
the lying posture. This wandering mind should be noted as “going, 
going” when it goes out, as “arriving, arriving” when it reaches a 
place, as “planning, reflecting, and so forth” on each state in the 
same manner as in the case of contemplation in the sitting posture. 
Mind generally vanishes on being noted once or twice. Then the usual 
exercise of noting as “rising, falling” should be reverted to. There 
may be also instances of swallowing or spitting saliva, or feeling of 
painful sensations, hot sensations, itching sensations, etc., or of 
bodily actions in changing the position and moving the limbs. They 
should be contemplated as each occurs. (When sufficient strength in 
Concentration is gained it will be possible even to carry on with the 
contemplation of each act of opening and closing of the eyelids and 
winking.) Afterwards one should then return to the usual exercise 
when there is no other thing to do. 

Though it is late in the night and it is time for sleep, it is not 
advisable to give up the contemplation and go to sleep. Anyone who 
has a keen interest in contemplation must be prepared to face the 
risk of spending many nights without sleep. 

The scriptures are emphatic on the necessity of developing the 
very qualities of Energetic Vigor Which Consists of Four Limbs, i.e., 
varieties (calu-ranga viriya) in the practice of meditation. In the hard 
struggle one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin, bone and 
sinew when his flesh and blood wither away and dry up but he 
should not give up his efforts so long as he has not attained whatever 
is attainable by manly perseverance, energy and endeavor. These 
instructions should be followed with a strong determination. It may 
be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough Concentration to 


28 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


beat off the sleep but he will fall asleep if sleep gets an upper hand. 
When one feels sleepy he should make a note as “sleepy, sleepy”; 
when the eyelids are drooping as “drooping, drooping”; dazzled as 
“dazzled, dazzled.” After the contemplation in the manner indicated 
one may be able to shake off the sleepiness and feel fresh again. This 
feeling should be noted as “feeling fresh, feeling fresh” and after 
which the usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling” should be 
reverted to. However, in spite of his determination one may feel 
unable to keep himself awake if he is very sleepy. In a lying posture 
it is more easy to fall asleep. A beginner should therefore try to keep 
himself mostly in the postures of sitting and walking. 

But when the night is late he will be compelled to lie down and 
proceed with the contemplation of “rising” and “falling.” In this 
position he may perhaps fall asleep. During the time of sleep it is not 
possible to carry on with the contemplation. It is an interval for a 
Yogi to relax. An hour’s sleep will give him an hour’s relaxation and 
if he continues to sleep for two, three or four hours he will get 
relaxation for longer hours. But it would not be advisable for a Yogi 
to sleep more than four hours, which is pretty long and ample for a 
normal sleep. 

On waking up a Yogi should start his contemplation from the 
moment of awakening. To be fully occupied with intent 
contemplation throughout the waking hours is the routine of a Yogi 
who works hard with true aspiration for the attainment of Path and 
its Fruition. If it is not possible to catch the waking moment, he 
should start with the usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling.” Or 
if he becomes aware firstly of the fact of reflecting he should begin 
his contemplation by noting as “reflecting, reflecting,” and then 
revert to the usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling.” Or if he 
becomes aware firstly of hearing a voice or sound he should begin by 
noting as “hearing, hearing,” and then revert to the usual exercise. As 
soon as one wakes up there may be bodily actions in turning this side 
or that side, and in moving the hands and legs and so forth. These 
actions should be contemplated in successive order. Or if he becomes 
aware of the mind leading to various bodily actions he should start 
his contemplation by noting the mind in the first place. Or if he 


29 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


becomes aware firstly of the painful sensations he should start by 
noting the painful sensations and then proceed with bodily actions. 
If he stays quietly without moving, the usual exercise of noting as 
“rising, falling” should be attended to. If he intends to get up he 
should note as “intending, intending” and then proceed with the 
noting of all actions serially in bringing the legs and hands into 
position. It should be noted as “raising, raising” on raising the body, 
as “sitting, sitting” when the body is erect and in sitting posture, and 
if there are any other actions of bringing legs and hands into position 
these actions should also be noted. If there are no particular things 
the usual exercise of noting as “rising, falling” should be reverted to. 

So far, things relating to the objects of contemplation in 
connection with the four postures and changing from one posture to 
another have been mentioned. It is merely a description of the 
general outline of major objects of contemplation to be carried out 
in the course of practice. Yet in the beginning of the practice, it is 
difficult to follow up all of them in contemplation. Many things will 
be omitted. But on gaining sufficient strength in Concentration it is 
easy to follow up in contemplation not only those already 
enumerated but many more. With gradual development of 
Mindfulness and Concentration the pace of Spiritual Knowledge 
quickens, and thus many more can be perceived. It is necessary to 
work up to this high level. 


Contemplation should be carried out also in the case of washing 
the face in the morning or when taking a bath. As it is necessary to 
act quickly in these cases, contemplation should be carried out to 
such an extent as far as possible in these circumstances. On stretching 
the hand to catch hold of the mug as “stretching”; on catching hold 
of the mug as “holding”; on dipping the mug as “dipping”; on 
bringing the mug towards the body as “bringing”; on pouring the 
water as “pouring”; on feeling cold as “cold”; on rubbing as 
“rubbing” and so on. There are also many actions in changing or 
arranging the dress, in arranging the bed or bed sheets, and in 
opening the door and so on. These actions should be contemplated in 
detail serially as much as possible.

At the time of taking meal contemplation should be started from 
the time of looking at the meal table as “looking, seeing; looking, 
seeing”; when stretching the hand to the plate as “stretching, 
stretching”; when the hand touches the food as “touching, hot, hot”; 
when gathering the food as “gathering, gathering”; when catching 
hold of the food as “catching, catching”; after lifting when the hand 
is being brought up as “bringing, bringing”; when the neck is being 
bent down as “bending, bending”; when the food is being placed in 
the mouth as “placing, placing”; when withdrawing the hand as 
“withdrawing, withdrawing”; when the hand touches the plate as 
“touching, touching”; when the neck is being straightened as 
“straightening, straightening”; when chewing the food as “chewing, 
chewing”; at the time of chewing when the taste of food is known as 
“knowing, knowing”; when he likes the taste as “liking, liking”; 
when he finds it pleasant as “pleasant, pleasant”; when swallowing as 
“swallowing, swallowing.” This is an illustration of the routine of 
contemplation on partaking of each morsel of food till the meal is 
finished. In this case also it is difficult to follow up all actions at the 
beginning of the practice. There will be many omissions. He should 
not, however, hesitate but must try and follow up as much as he can. 
With the gradual advancement of the practice it will be easy to note 
many more than those mentioned here. 

Now the lessons for the practical exercise of contemplation are 
almost complete. As they are explained in detail and at some length 
it is not easy to remember all of them. For the sake of easy memory, 
a summary of important and essential points will be mentioned. 
They are few. 

In the case of taking a walk a Yogi should contemplate the 
movements of the steps. While walking briskly each step should be 
noted as “right step, left step” respectively. Mind should be fixed 
intently on the movement of each step. While in the course of 
walking slowly each step should be noted in two sections as “lifting, 
putting; lifting, putting.” While in a sitting posture the usual exercise 
of contemplation by noting the movements of the abdomen as 
“rising, falling, rising, falling” should be carried out. The same 
manner of contemplation by noting as “rising, falling, rising, falling” 
should be carried out in the case of lying posture also. 


31 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


If it is found that the mind wanders during the course of noting as 
“rising, falling,” it should not be let off but it should be followed up 
immediately. On imagining it should be noted as “imagining, 
imagining”; on thinking as “thinking, thinking”; on the mind going 
out as “going, going”; on the mind arriving at a place as “arriving, 
arriving”; and so forth on every occurrence. And the usual exercise 
of noting as “rising, falling” should then be reverted to. When there 
occur feelings of tiredness in hands, legs or other limbs, or of hot or 
prickly or aching or itching sensations, they should be immediately 
followed up and noted as “tired, hot, prickly, aching, itching, and so 
on” as the case may be. A return should then be made to the usual 
exercise of noting as “rising, falling.” When there are acts of bending 
or stretching the hands and legs, or moving the neck or limbs, or 
swaying the body to and fro, they should be followed up and noted 
in the serial order as they occur. The usual exercise of noting as 
rising, falling” should then be reverted to. 

If the practice is proceeded with in the manner indicated, the 
number of objects will gradually increase in course of time. At first 
there will be many omissions because mind used to wander without 
any restraint. However, one should not lose heart on this account. 
This difficulty is usually encountered in the beginning of the 
practice. After some time mind cannot play truant any longer 
because it is always found out every time it roves. It therefore 
remains fixedly on an object to which it is directed. As rising occurs 
the mind makes a note of it, and thus the object and the mind 
coincide. As falling occurs the mind makes a note of it and thus these 
two coincide. There is always a pair of object and the mind which 
knows the object at every time of noting. These two elements of 
material object and knowing mind only arise in pairs, and apart from 
these two there does not exist any other thing either in the form of a 
person or self. This fact will be perceptible personally in due course. 

The fact that matter and mind are two separate things will be 
clearly perceived during the time of noting as “rising, falling.” The 
two elements of matter and mind are linked up in a pair and their 
arising coincides, that is, the material process of rising coincides with 
the mind knowing it, the material process of falling coincides with 


32 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


the mind knowing it, and the respective processes of lifting, pushing, 
putting coincide with the respective minds knowing the processes. 
This knowledge in respect of matter and mind rising separately is 
called Spiritual Knowledge of Insight (nama-rupa-pariceheda-nana). 
It is the preliminary stage in the whole course of Spiritual Knowledge 
of Insight. It is important to have this preliminary stage developed in 
a proper manner. 

On continuing the practice of contemplation for some time, there 
will be a considerable progress in Mindfulness and Concentration. At 
this high level it will be perceptible that, on every occasion of noting, 
each process arises and vanishes at the very moment. But it is, on the 
other hand, considered generally by uninstructed people that body 
and mind remain in a permanent state throughout the life or 
existence, that the same body of childhood has grown up into 
manhood, that the same young mind has grown up into maturity and 
that both body and mind are one and the same person. The real fact 
is not so. Nothing is permanent. Every thing comes into existence for 
a moment, and then vanishes. Nothing can remain even for a winking 
moment. Changes are taking place very swiftly and they will be 
perceived in due course. While carrying on the contemplation by 
noting as “rising, falling” and so forth one would perceive that these 
processes generally come up and disappear one after another in 
succession very swiftly. On thus perceiving that every thing vanishes 
on the very point of noting, a Yogi is satisfied with the fact that 
nothing is permanent. This knowledge regarding the impermanent 
state of things is Spiritual Insight Into Transience 
(aniccanupassana-nana). 

A Yogi then feels that this ever-changing state of things is 
distressing and not to be desired. This is Insight Into Suffering 
(dukkanupassana-nana). And on suffering also many painful feelings 
it is regarded as a mere heap of suffering. This, too, is of the same 
insight. 

Then it is perceived that the elements of matter and mind never 
follow one’s wish but they act according to their own nature and 
conditioning. While being engaged in the act of noting the processes, 
a Yogi is convinced that these processes are not controllable and they 


33 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


are neither person nor living entity nor self in the real sense. This is 
Insight Into the Absence of A Self (anattanupassana-nana). 

When a Yogi has fully developed the Insights into Impermanence, 
Suffering, and Absence of A Self, he will realize Nirvana. From time 
immemorial Buddhas, Arhats and Holy Ones realized Nirvana by this 
means of Vipassana. It is the high way leading to Nirvana. As a 
matter of fact, Vipassana consists of the four Applications of 
Mindfulness (satipatthanas) and is therefore the high way to Nirvana. 

Yogis have now come to take up the course of training in 
contemplation. It should be borne in mind that they are on the high 
way which had been taken by Buddhas, Arhats and Holy Ones. This 
opportunity is afforded to them apparently because of their 
Perfections of previous endeavors in seeking and wishing for it, and 
also of their present mature condition. They should rejoice at heart 
for being availed of this opportunity. They should also feel assured 
that by walking on this high way without wavering, they will gain the 
personal experience of the highly developed Concentration and 
Knowledge as had already been known to Buddhas, Arhats and Holy 
Ones. They will develop such a pure state of Concentration as has 
never been known before in the course of their life and thus enjoy 
many innocent pleasures as a result of the advanced Concentration. 

They will also learn the practical knowledge of Impermanence, 
Suffering, and the Absence of A Self by having a direct personal 
experience of the actual facts, and then realize Nirvana on the full 
development of these knowledges. It will not take long to achieve the 
object, but possibly in a month, or twenty days, or fifteen days; or 
on rare occasions even in seven days for a selected few with 
extraordinary Perfection. 

Yogis should, therefore, proceed with the practice of 
contemplation in great earnest and with full confidence trusting that 
it will surely lead to the development of Spiritual Knowledge of the 
Path and Its Fruition, and to the Realization of Nirvana. They will 
then be free from the Erroneous View That There is A Self (sakkaya- 
ditthi) and Doubt (vicikiccha) and will no longer be subject to the 
round of rebirths in the miserable existence of hell, animals or 
hungry ghosts.

PREFACE 


It is a truism to say that nobody likes suffering and 
everybody seeks happiness. In this world of ours, human 
beings are making all possible efforts for prevention and 
alleviation of suffering, and enjoyment of happiness. But 
nevertheless their efforts are mainly directed to the physi¬ 
cal well-being by material means. Happiness is, after all, 
conditioned by attitudes of mind, and yet only a few 
persons give real thought to mental development, fewer 
still who practice mind training in earnest. 

To illustrate this point, attention may be drawn to the 
commonplace habits of cleaning and tidying up one’s 
body, the endless pursuits of food, clothing and shelter, 
and the tremendous technological progress achieved for 
raising the material standard of living, for improving the 
means of transport and communications, and for preven¬ 
tion and cure of diseases and ailments. All these strivings 
are, in the main, concerned with the care and nourish¬ 
ment of the body. It must be recognized that they are 
essential. However, these human efforts and achievements 
cannot possibly bring about the alleviation or eradication 
of suffering associated with old age and disease, domestic 
infelicity and economic troubles, in short, with nonsatis¬ 
faction of wants and desires. Sufferings of this nature are 
not overcome by material means; they can be overcome 
only by mind training and mental development. 

Then, it becomes clear that the right way must be 
sought for training, stabilizing and purifying the mind. 
This way is found in the Maha Satipatthana Sutra, a 


5 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


well-known discourse of the Buddha, delivered well over 
2500 years ago. The Buddha declared thus: 

“This is the sole way for the purification of beings, for 
the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the 
destroying of pain and grief, for reaching the right path, 
for the realization of nirvana, namely the four founda¬ 
tions of mindfulness.” 

The four foundations of mindfulness are (1) the con¬ 
templation of the body, (2) the contemplation of feel¬ 
ings, (3) the contemplation of mind, and (4) the contem¬ 
plation of mind objects. 

Obviously, this way should be followed by those in 
search of happiness, with a view to getting rid of the 
impurities of mind, which are the causes of their suffer¬ 
ings. 

If one were asked whether he wishes to overcome 
sorrow and lamentation, he would surely say, “Yes.” 
Then, he, nay everybody, should practice the four foun¬ 
dations of mindfulness. 

If one were asked whether he wishes to destroy pain 
and grief, he would not hesitate to reply in the affirma¬ 
tive. Then, he, nay everybody, should practice the four 
foundations of mindfulness. 

If one were asked whether he wishes to reach the right 
path and realize nirvana, the state of being absolutely free 
from old age, decay and death and from all sufferings, he 
would certainly give an affirmative answer. Then, he, nay 
everybody, should practice the four foundations of mind¬ 
fulness. 

How shall one practice the four foundations of mind¬ 
fulness? In the Maha Satipatthana Sutra, the Buddha said, 
“Dwell practicing body contemplation, feeling contem¬ 
plation, mind contemplation and mind objects contem¬ 
plation.” Without the guidance of a well-qualified 
teacher, however, it will not be easy for an average person 
to practice these contemplations in a systematic manner 
in order to make progress towards development of con¬ 
centration and insight. 

Having undergone myself a most intensive practical 


6 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


course of satipatthana meditation under the personal 
guidance of the Most Venerable Mingun Jetavan Sayadaw 
of Thaton, I imparted the technique of meditation ever 
since 1938 and gave personal instruction as well as 
through books and lectures to several thousands of yogis. 
In compliance with the requests of those of the earlier 
batches, who had benefited by my personal instructions, 
I wrote a treatise on vipassana or insight meditation, in 
two volumes. The treatise was completed in the year 
1944 and has been published in seven editions. In all the 
chapters, except in Chapter V, dissertations and discus¬ 
sions are made with references to Pali texts, commen¬ 
taries and subcommentaries. In Chapter V, I chose to 
write in common language for easy understanding by my 
pupils as to how they should begin and then proceed step 
by step, stating fully the salient features, in line with 
Visuddhimagga and some other texts. 

This present book is the English translation of the said 
Chapter V. The first fourteen pages of the Burmese origi¬ 
nal were translated into English in 1954 by U Pe Thin, an 
old pupil of mine, for the benefit of those who came 
from abroad to our Meditation Center. Pages 15 to 51 of 
the Burmese original were translated into English, in 
compliance with the wish of the Venerable Nyanaponika 
Mahathera, by Myanaung U Tin, a disciple and dayaka of 
mine. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the area of 
our Meditation Center, Thathana Yeiktha, is nearly 
twenty-four acres, with over fifty buildings to house the 
meditation teachers and yogis, monks as well as lay, both 
men and women. 

The Venerable Nyanaponika Mahathera put this trans¬ 
lation into final literary shape after obtaining confirma¬ 
tion of his valuable suggestions. U Pe Thin’s translation 
was revised by and improved upon, as to style, by Miss 
Mary McCollum, an American Buddhist lady. She prac¬ 
ticed satipatthana meditation under the guidance of 
Anagarika Munindra at Burmese Vihara, Bodh-Gaya, 
Bihar, India. Anagarika Munindra stayed with us for a 
considerable period. He sent her revision to us for perusal 


7 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


and approval. When done, it was forwarded to the Vener¬ 
able Nyanaponika Mahathera. This book is, therefore, the 
coordination and combined publication of the aforesaid 
two translations, with my preface added thereto. 

Chapter V of my Burmese treatise, as mentioned ear¬ 
lier, was written in common linguistic style. I should like 
to say here that the doctrinal terms found in this book 
without Pali names are fully explained in “Progress of 
Insight,” translated from my Pali treatise into English by 
the Venerable Nyanaponika Mahathera. His book, The 
Heart of Buddhist Meditation, is itself a veritable mine of 
information and instruction on this subject of vital 
importance. 

In conclusion, I would like (1) to say that I deeply 
appreciate the services of those who have done the trans¬ 
lations and revisions as well as of those who are respon¬ 
sible for the publication of this book, (2) to urge the 
readers of this book not to be content with the theoreti¬ 
cal knowledge contained therein but to apply that know¬ 
ledge to systematic and sustained practice, and (3) to 
express my earnest wish that they gain insight soon and 
enjoy all the benefits vouchsafed by the Buddha in the 
preamble of the Maha Satipatthana Sutra.

Part I 

Basic Practice 


Preparatory Stage 

If you sincerely desire to develop contemplation and 
attain insight in this your present life, you must give up 
worldly thoughts and actions during training. This course 
of action is for the purification of conduct, the essential 
preliminary step towards the proper development of con¬ 
templation. You must also observe the rules of discipline 
prescribed for laymen (or for monks, as the case may be), 
for they are important in gaining insight. For layfolk, 
these rules comprise the eight precepts which Buddhist 
devotees observe on holidays (uposatha) and during per¬ 
iods of meditation. 1 An additional rule is not to speak 
with contempt, in jest, or malice to or about any of the 
noble ones who have attained states of sanctity. 2 If you 
have done so, then personally apologize to him or her or 
make the apology through your meditation instructor. If 
in the past you have spoken contemptuously to a noble 
one who is presently unavailable or deceased, confess this 
offense to your meditation instructor or introspectively 
to yourself. 

The old masters of Buddhist tradition suggest that you 
entrust yourself to the enlightened one, the Buddha, 
during training period, for you may be alarmed if it 
happens that your own state of mind produces unwhole¬ 
some or frightening visions during contemplation. Also 
place yourself under the guidance of your meditation 
instructor, for, then, he can talk to you frankly about 
your work in contemplation and give you the guidance he 
thinks necessary. These are the advantages of placing 


9 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


trust in the enlightened one, the Buddha, and practicing 
under the guidance of your instructor. The aim of this 
practice and its greatest benefit is release from greed, 
hatred and delusion, which are the roots of all evil and 
suffering. This intensive course in insight training can lead 
you to such release. So work ardently with this end in 
view so that your training will be successfully completed. 
This kind of training in contemplation, based on the 
foundations of mindfulness (satipatthana), had been 
taken by successive buddhas and noble ones who attained 
release. You are to be congratulated on having the oppor¬ 
tunity to take the same kind of training they had under¬ 
gone. 

It is also important for you to begin your training with 
a brief contemplation on the “four protections” which 
the enlightened one, the Buddha, offers you for reflec¬ 
tion. It is helpful for your psychological welfare at this 
stage to reflect on them. The subjects of these four 
protective reflections are the Buddha himself, loving¬ 
kindness, the loathsome aspects of the body, and death. 

First, devote yourself to the Buddha by sincerely 
appreciating his nine chief qualities in this way: 

Truly, the Buddha is holy, fully enlightened, per¬ 
fect in knowledge and conduct, a welfarer, world- 
knower, the incomparable leader of men to be 
tamed, teacher of gods and mankind, the awakened 
and exalted one. 

Second, reflect upon all sentient beings as the receivers 
of your lovingkindness, be fortified by your thoughts of 
lovingkindness and identify yourself with all sentient 
beings without distinction, thus: 

May I be free from enmity, disease and grief .... 

As I am, so also may my parents, preceptors, 
teachers, intimate, indifferent and inimical beings be 
free from enmity, disease and grief. May they be 
released from suffering. 

Third, reflect upon the repulsive nature of the body to 
assist you in diminishing the unwholesome attachment 
that so many people have for the body. Dwell upon some 
of its impurities, such as stomach, intestines, phlegm, pus, 


10 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


blood. 3 Ponder these impurities so that the absurd fond¬ 
ness of the body may be eliminated. 

The fourth protection for your psychological benefit is 
to reflect on the phenomenon of ever-approaching death. 
Buddhist teachings stress that life is uncertain, but death 
is certain, life is precarious, but death is sure. Life has 
death as its goal. There is birth, disease, suffering, old age, 
and eventual death. These are all aspects of the process of 
existence. 

To begin training, take the sitting posture with legs 
crossed. You might feel more comfortable if the legs are 
not interlocked but evenly placed on the ground, without 
pressing one against the other. If you find that sitting on 
the floor interferes with contemplation, then obtain a 
more comfortable way of sitting. Now proceed with each 
exercise in contemplation as described.

Basic Exercise I 

Try to keep your mind (but not your eyes) on the 
abdomen. You will thereby come to know the move¬ 
ments of rising and falling of this organ. If these move¬ 
ments are not clear to you in the beginning, then place 
both hands on the abdomen to feel these rising and 
falling movements. After a short time the upward move¬ 
ment of inhalation and the downward movement of 
exhalation will become clear. Then make a mental note, 
rising for the upward movement, falling for the down¬ 
ward movement. Your mental note of each movement 
must be made while it occurs. From this exercise you 
learn the actual manner of the upward and downward 
movements of the abdomen. You are not concerned with 
the form of the abdomen. What you actually perceive is 
the bodily sensation of pressure caused by the heaving 
movement of the abdomen. So do not dwell on the form 
of the abdomen but proceed with the exercise. For the 
beginner it is a very effective method of developing the 
faculties of attention, concentration of mind and insight 
in contemplation. As practice increases, the manner of 
movement will be clearer. The ability to know each 
successive occurrence of the mental and physical pro¬ 
cesses at each of the six sense organs is acquired only 
when insight contemplation is fully developed. Since you 
are a beginner whose attentiveness and power of concen¬ 
tration are still weak, you may find it difficult to keep 
the mind on each successive rising movement and falling 
movement as it occurs. In view of this difficulty, you 
may be inclined to think: “I just don’t know how to keep 
my mind on each of these movements.” Then simply 
remember that this is a learning process. The rising and 
falling movements of the abdomen are always present, 
and therefore there is no need to look for them. Actually 
it is easy for a beginner to keep his or her mind on these 
two simple movements. Continue with this exercise in 
full awareness of the abdomen’s rising and falling move¬ 
ments. Never verbally repeat the words rising, falling, and 


12 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


do not think of rising and falling as words. Be aware only 
of the actual process of the rising and falling movement 
of the abdomen. Avoid deep or rapid breathing for the 
purpose of making the abdominal movements more dis¬ 
tinct, because this procedure causes fatigue that interferes 
with the practice. Just be totally aware of the movements 
of rising and falling as they occur in the course of normal 
breathing. 



13 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


Basic Exercise II 

While occupied with the exercise of observing each of 
the abdominal movements, other mental activities may 
occur between the noting of each rising and falling. 
Thoughts or other mental functions, such as intentions, 
ideas, imaginings, are likely to occur between each mental 
note of rising and falling. They cannot be disregarded. A 
mental note must be made of each as it occurs. 

If you imagine something, you must know that you 
have done so and make a mental note imagining. If you 
simply think of something, mentally note thinking. If 
you reflect, reflecting. If you intend to do something, 
intending. When the mind wanders from the object of 
meditation which is the rising and falling of the abdomen, 
mentally note wandering. Should you imagine you are 
going to a certain place, mentally note going. When you 
arrive, arriving. When, in your thoughts, you meet a 
person, note meeting. Should you speak to him or her, 
speaking. If you imaginatively argue with that person, 
arguing. If you envision and imagine a light or color, be 
sure to note seeing. A mental vision must be noted on 
each occurrence of its appearance until it passes away. 
After its disappearance, continue with the Basic Exer¬ 
cise I by knowing, by being fully aware of each move¬ 
ment of the rising and falling abdomen. Proceed care¬ 
fully, without slackening. If you intend to swallow saliva 
while thus engaged, make a mental note intending. While 
in the act of swallowing, swallowing. If you intend to 
spit, spitting. Then return to the exercise of rising and 
falling. Suppose you intend to bend the neck, intending. 
In the act of bending, bending. When you intend to 
straighten the neck, intending. In the act of straightening 
the neck, straightening. The neck movements of bending 
and straightening must be done slowly. After mentally 
making a note of each of these actions, proceed in full 
awareness with noticing the movements of the rising and 
falling abdomen. 


14 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


Basic Exercise III 

Since you must continue contemplating for a long time 
while in one position, that of sitting or lying down, you 
are likely to experience an intense feeling of fatigue, 
stiffness in the body or in the arms and legs. Should this 
happen, simply keep the knowing mind on that part of 
the body where such feeling occurs and carry on the 
contemplation, noting tired or stiff. Do this naturally, 
that is, neither too fast nor too slow. These feelings 
gradually become fainter and finally cease altogether. 
Should one of these feelings become more intense until 
the bodily fatigue or stiffness of joints is unbearable, then 
change your position. However, do not forget to make a 
mental note of intending , before you proceed to change 
position. Each detailed movement must be contemplated 
in its respective order. 

If you intend to lift the hand or leg, make a mental 
note, intending. In the act of lifting the hand or leg, 
lifting. Stretching either the hand or leg, stretching. When 
you bend, bending. When putting down, putting. Should 
either the hand or leg touch, touching. Perform all these 
actions in a slow deliberate manner. As soon as you are 
settled in the new position, continue with the contem¬ 
plation of the abdominal movements. If you become 
uncomfortably warm in the new position resume contem¬ 
plation in another position keeping to the procedure as 
described in this paragraph. 

Should an itching sensation be felt in any part of the 
body, keep the mind on that part and make a mental 
note, itching. Do this in a regulated manner, neither too 
fast nor too slow. When the itching sensation disappears 
in the course of full awareness, continue with the exercise 
of noticing the rising and falling of the abdomen. Should 
the itching continue and become too strong and you 
intend to rub the itching part, be sure to make a mental 
note, intending. Slowly lift the hand, simultaneously not¬ 
ing the action of lifting, and touching when the hand 
touches the part that itches. Rub slowly in complete 


15 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


awareness of rubbing. When the itching sensation has 
disappeared and you intend to discontinue the rubbing, 
be mindful by making the usual mental note of intending. 
Slowly withdraw the hand, concurrently making a mental 
note of the action, withdrawing. When the-hand rests in 
its usual place touching the leg, touching. Then again 
devote your time to observing the abdominal movements. 

If there is pain or discomfort, keep the knowing mind 
on that part of the body where the sensation arises. Make 
a mental note of the specific sensation as it occurs, such 
as painful, aching, pressing, piercing, tired, giddy. It must 
be stressed that the mental note must not be forced nor 
delayed but made in a calm and natural manner. The pain 
may eventually cease or increase. Do not be alarmed if'it 
increases. Firmly continue the contemplation. If you do 
so, you will find that the pain will almost always cease. 
But if, after a time, the pain has increased and becomes 
almost unbearable, you must ignore the pain and con¬ 
tinue with the contemplation of rising and falling. 

As you progress in mindfulness you may experience 
sensations of intense pain: stifling or choking sensations, 
such as pain from the slash of a knife, the thrust of a 
sharp-pointed instrument, unpleasant sensations of being 
pricked by sharp needles, or small insects crawling over 
the body. You might experience sensations of itching, 
biting, intense cold. As soon as you discontinue the 
contemplation you may also feel that these painful sensa 
tions cease. When you resume contemplation you wil 
have them again as soon as you gain in mindfulness. 
These painful sensations are not to be considered as 
something serious. They are not manifestations of disease 
but are common factors always present in the body and 
are usually obscured when the mind is normally occupied 
with more conspicuous objects. When the mental facul¬ 
ties become keener you are more aware of these sensa¬ 
tions. With the continued development of contemplation 
the time will arrive when you can overcome them and 
they cease altogether. If you continue contemplation, 
firm in purpose, you will not come to any harm. Should 


16 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


you lose courage, become irresolute in contemplation and 
discontinue for a time, you may encounter these unpleas¬ 
ant sensations again and again as your contemplation 
proceeds. If you continue with determination you will 
most likely overcome these painful sensations and may 
never again experience them in the course of contempla¬ 
tion. 

Should you intend to sway the body, then knowingly 
note intending. While in the act of swaying, swaying. 
When contemplating you may occasionally discover the 
body swaying back and forth. Do not be alarmed; neither 
be pleased nor wish to continue to sway. The swaying 
will cease if you keep the knowing mind on the action of 
swaying and continue to note swaying until the action 
ceases. If swaying increases in spite of your making a 
mental note of it, then lean against a wall or post or lie 
down for a while. Thereafter proceed with contempla¬ 
tion. Follow the same procedure if you find yourself 
shaking or trembling. When contemplation is developed 
you may sometimes feel a thrill or chill pass through the 
back or the entire body. This is a symptom of the feeling 
of intense interest, enthusiasm or rapture. It occurs natur¬ 
ally in the course of good contemplation. When your 
mind is fixed in contemplation you may be startled at the 
slightest sound. This takes place because you feel more 
intensely the effect of sensorial impression while in the 
state of good concentration. 

If you are thirsty while contemplating, notice the 
feeling, thirsty. When you intend to stand, intending. 
Then make a mental note of each movement in prepara¬ 
tion for standing. Keep the mind intently on the act of 
standing up, and mentally note, standing. When you look 
forward after standing up straight, note looking, seeing. 
Should you intend to walk forward, intending. When you 
begin to step forward, mentally note each step as walk¬ 
ing, walking or left, right. It is important for you to be 
aware of every moment in each step from beginning to 
end when you walk. Adhere to the same procedure when 
strolling or when taking a walking exercise. Try to make a 


17 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


mental note of each step in two sections as follows: 
lifting, putting; lifting, putting. When you have obtained 
sufficient practice in this manner of walking, then try to 
make a mental note of each step in three sections: lifting, 
pushing, putting; or up, forward, down. 

When you look at the water faucet, or water pot, on 
arriving at the place where you are to take a drink, be 
sure to make a mental note looking, seeing. 

When you stop walking, stopping. 

When you stretch the hand, stretching. 

When the hand touches the cup, touching. 

When the hand takes the cup, taking. 

When the hand dips the cup into the water, dipping. 

When the hand brings the cup to the lips, bringing. 

When the cup touches the lips, touching. 

Should you feel cold at the touch, cold. 

When you swallow, swallowing. 

When returning the cup, returning. 

Withdrawing the hand, withdrawing. 

When you bring down your hand, bringing. 

When the hand touches the side of the body, touching. 

If you intend to turn back, intending. 

When you turn around, turning. 

When you walk forward, walking. 

On arriving at the place where you intend to stop, 
intending. 

When you stop, stopping. 

If you remain standing for some time continue the 
contemplation of rising and falling. But if you intend to 
sit down, intending. When you go forward to sit down, 
walking. On arriving at the place where you will sit, 
arriving. When you turn to sit, turning. While in the act of 
sitting, sitting. Sit down slowly, and keep the mind on 
the downward movement of the body. You must notice 
every movement in bringing hands and legs into position. 
Then resume the prescribed exercise of contemplating the 
abdominal movements. 

Should you intend to lie down, intending. Then pro- 


18 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


ceed with the contemplation of every movement in the 
course of lying down: lifting, stretching, leaving, touch¬ 
ing, lying. Then make as the object of contemplation 
every movement in bringing hands, legs, and body into 
position. Perform these actions slowly. Thereafter con¬ 
tinue with rising and falling. Should pain, fatigue, itching, 
or any other sensation be felt, be sure to notice each of 
these sensations. Notice all feelings, thoughts, ideas, con¬ 
siderations, reflections, all movements of hands, legs, 
arms and body. If there is nothing in particular to note, 
put the mind on rising and falling of the abdomen. Make 
a mental note of drowsy, when drowsy, and sleepy, when 
sleepy. After you have gained sufficient concentration in 
contemplating you will be able to overcome drowsiness 
and sleepiness and feel refreshed as a result. Take up 
again the usual contemplation of the basic object. Sup¬ 
pose you are unable to overcome a drowsy feeling; you 
must then continue to contemplate until you fall asleep. 

The state of sleep is the continuity of subconscious¬ 
ness. It is similar to the first state of rebirth consciousness 
and the last state of consciousness at the moment of 
death. This state of consciousness is feeble and therefore 
unable to be aware of an object. When you are awake the 
continuity of subconsciousness occurs regularly between 
moments of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, 
and thinking. Because these occurrences are of brief dura¬ 
tion they are usually not clear and therefore not notice¬ 
able. Continuity of subconsciousness remains during 
sleep—a fact which becomes obvious when you wake up; 
for it is in the state of wakefulness that thoughts and 
dense objects become distinct. 

Contemplation should start at the moment you wake 
up. Since you are a beginner, it may not yet be possible 
for you to start contemplating at the very first moment 
of wakefulness. But you should start with it from the 
moment when you remember that you are to contem¬ 
plate. For example, if on awakening you reflect on some¬ 
thing, you should become aware of that fact and begin 
your contemplation by a mental note, reflecting. Then 


19 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling. 
When getting up from the bed, mindfulness should be 
directed to every detail of the body’s activity. Each 
movement of the hands, legs and rump must be per¬ 
formed in complete awareness. Are you thinking of the 
time of the day when awakening? If so, note thinking. Do 
you intend to get out of bed? If so, note intending. If 
you prepare to move the body into position for rising, 
note preparing. As you slowly rise, rising. When you are 
in the sitting position, sitting. Should you remain sitting 
for any length of time, revert to contemplating the 
abdominal movements of rising and falling. 

Perform the acts of washing the face or taking a bath 
in their order and in complete awareness of every detailed 
movement; for instance, looking, seeing, stretching, hold¬ 
ing, touching, feeling cold, rubbing. In the acts of dress¬ 
ing, making the bed, opening and closing doors and 
windows, handling objects, be occupied with every detail 
of these actions in their order. 

You must attend to the contemplation of every detail 
in the action of eating: 

When you look at the food, looking, seeing. 

When you arrange the food, arranging. 

When you bring the food to mouth, bringing. 

When you bend the neck forward, bending. 

When the food touches the mouth, touching. 

When placing the food in the mouth, placing. 

When the mouth closes, closing. 

When withdrawing the hand, withdrawing. 

Should the hand touch the plate, touching. 

When straightening the neck, straightening. 

When in the act of chewing, chewing. 

When you are aware of the taste, knowing. 

When swallowing the food, swallowing. 

While swallowing, should the food be felt touching the 
sides of the gullet, touching. 

Perform contemplation in this manner each time you 
partake of a morsel of food until you finish the meal. In 


20 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


the beginning of the practice there will be many omis¬ 
sions. Never mind. Do not waver in your effort. You will 
make fewer omissions if you persist in your practice. 
When you reach an advanced stage of the practice, you 
will also be able to notice more details than those men¬ 
tioned here. 

Advancement in Contemplation 

After having practiced for a day and night you may 
find your contemplation considerably improved and that 
you are able to prolong the basic exercise of noticing the 
abdominal rising and falling. At this time you will notice 
that there is generally a break between the movements of 
rising and falling. If you are in the sitting posture fill in 
this pause with a mental note on the act of sitting, in this 
way: rising, falling, sitting. When you make a mental note 
of sitting, keep your mind on the erect position of the 
upper body. When you are lying down you should pro¬ 
ceed with full awareness as follows: rising, falling, lying. 
If you find this easy, continue with noticing these three 
sections. Should you notice that a pause occurs at the 
end of the rising as well as the falling movement, then 
continue in this manner: rising, sitting, falling, sitting. Or 
when lying down: rising, lying, falling, lying. Suppose 
you no longer find it easy to make a mental note of three 
or four objects in the above manner. Then revert to the 
initial procedure of noting only the two sections, rising 
and falling. 

While engaged in the regular practice of contemplating 
bodily movements you need not be concerned with 
objects of seeing and hearing. As long as you are able to 
keep your mind on the abdominal movements of rising 
and falling it is assumed that the purpose of noticing the 
acts and objects of seeing and hearing is also served. 
However, you may intentionally look at an object, then 
simultaneously make a mental note, two or three times, 
seeing. Thereafter return to the awareness of the abdomi¬ 
nal movements. Suppose some person comes into your 
view. Make a mental note of seeing, two or three times. 


21 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


and then resume attention to the rising and falling move¬ 
ments of the abdomen. Did you happen to hear the 
sound of a voice? Did you listen to it? If so make the 
mental note of hearing, listening, and having done so, 
revert to rising and falling. But suppose you heard loud 
sounds, such as the barking of dogs, loud talking or 
singing. If so, immediately make a mental note two or 
three times, hearing. Then return to your basic exercise 
of attending to rising and falling. If you fail to note and 
dismiss such distinctive sights and sounds as they occur, 
you may inadvertently fall into reflections about them 
instead of proceeding with intense attention to rising and 
falling, which may then become less distinct and clear. It 
is by such weakened attention that mind-defiling passions 
breed and multiply. If such reflections do occur, make 
two or three times the mental note, reflecting, and again 
take up the contemplation of rising and falling. Should 
you forget to make a mental note of body, leg or arm 
movements, then mentally note forgetting, and resume 
your usual contemplation of the abdominal movements. 
You may feel at times that breathing is slow or that the 
rising and falling movements of the abdomen are not 
clearly perceived. When this happens, and you are in the 
sitting position, simply carry on the attention to sitting, 
touching; if you are lying down, lying, touching. While 
contemplating touching, your mind should not be kept 
on the same part of the body but on different parts 
successively. There are several places of touch and at least 
six or seven should be contemplated. 4

Basic Exercise IV 

Up to this point you have devoted quite some time to 
the training course. You might begin to feel lazy after 
deciding that you have made inadequate progress. By no 
means give up. Simply note the fact, lazy. Before you 
gain sufficient strength in attention, concentration and 
insight, you may doubt the correctness or usefulness of 
this method of training. In such a circumstance turn to 
contemplation of the thought, doubtful. Do you antici¬ 
pate or wish for good results? If so, make such thoughts 
the subject of your contemplation, anticipating or wish¬ 
ing. Are you attempting to recall the manner in which 
this training was conducted up to this point? Yes? Then 
take up contemplation on recollecting. Are there occa¬ 
sions when you examine the object of contemplation to 
determine whether it is mind or matter? If so, then be 
aware of examining. Do you regret that there is no 
improvement in your contemplation? If so, then attend 
to that feeling of regret. Conversely, are you happy that 
your contemplation is improving? If you are, then con¬ 
template the feeling of being happy. This is the way in 
which you make a mental note of every item of mental 
behavior as it occurs, and if there are no intervening 
thoughts or perceptions to note, you should revert to the 
contemplation of rising and falling. During a strict course 
of meditation, the time of practice is from the first 
moment you wake up until you fall asleep. To repeat, 
you must be constantly occupied either with the basic 
exercise or with mindful attention throughout the day 
and during those night hours when you are not asleep. 
There must be no relaxation. Upon reaching a certain 
stage of progress in contemplation you will not feel 
sleepy in spite of these prolonged hours of practice. On 
the contrary, you will be able to continue the contempla¬ 
tion day and night. 

Summary 

It has been emphasized during this brief outline of the 


23 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


training that you must contemplate on each mental 
occurrence good or bad, on each bodily movement large 
or small, on every sensation (bodily or mental feeling) 
pleasant or unpleasant, and so on. If, during the course of 
training, occasions arise when there is nothing special to 
contemplate upon, be fully occupied with attention to 
the rising and falling of the abdomen. When you have to 
attend to any kind of activity that necessitates walking, 
then, in complete awareness, each step should be briefly 
noted as walking, walking or left, right. But when you are 
taking a walking exercise, contemplate each step in three 
sections, up, forward, down. The student who thus dedi¬ 
cates himself to the training during day and night, will be 
able in not too long a time to develop concentration to 
the initial stage of the fourth degree of insight (know¬ 
ledge of arising and passing away) 5 and onward to higher 
stages of insight meditation (vipassaria-bhavaria).

PART II 

Progressive Practice 


When as mentioned above, by dint of diligent practice, 
mindfulness and concentration have improved, the medi¬ 
tator will notice the pairwise occurrence of an object and 
the knowing of it, such as the rising and awareness of it, 
the falling and awareness of it, sitting and awareness of it, 
bending and awareness of it, stretching and awareness of 
it, lifting and awareness of it, putting down and aware¬ 
ness of it. Through concentrated attention (mindfulness) 
he knows how to distinguish each bodily and mental 
process: “The rising movement is one process; the know¬ 
ing of it is another.” He realizes that each act of knowing 
has the nature of “going towards an object.” Such a 
realization refers to the characteristic function of the 
mind as inclining towards an object, or cognizing an 
object. One should know that the more clearly a material 
object is noticed, the clearer becomes the mental process 
of knowing it. This fact is stated thus in the Visuddhi 
Magga: 

For in proportion as materiality becomes quite 
definite, disentangled and quite clear to him, so the 
immaterial states that have that materiality as their 
object become plain of themselves too” (The Path 
of Purification, translated by Bhikkhu Manamoli). 
When the meditator comes to know the difference 
between a bodily process and a mental process, should he 
be a simple man, he would reflect from direct experience 
thus: “There is the rising and knowing it; the falling and 
knowing it, and so on and so forth. There is nothing else 


25 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


besides them. The words ‘man’ or ‘woman’ refer to the 
same process; there is no ‘person’ or ‘soul’.” Should he be 
a well-informed man, he would reflect from direct know¬ 
ledge of the difference between a material process as 
object and a mental process of knowing it, thus: “It is 
true that there are only body and mind. Besides them 
there are none such entities as man or woman. While 
contemplating one notices a material process as object 
and a mental process of knowing it; and it is to that pair 
alone that the terms of conventional usage ‘being,’ ‘per¬ 
son’ or ‘soul,’ ‘man’ or ‘woman’ refer. But apart from 
that dual process there is no separate person or being, I or 
another, man or woman.” When such reflections occur, 
the meditator must note “reflecting, reflecting” and go 
on observing the rising of the abdomen, and its falling. 6 

With further progress in meditation, the conscious 
state of an intention is evident before a bodily movement 
occurs. The meditator first notices that intention. 
Though also at the start of his practice, he does notice 
“intending, intending” (for instance, to bend an arm), yet 
he cannot notice that state of consciousness distinctly. 
Now, at this more advanced stage, he clearly notices the 
consciousness consisting of the intention to bend. So he 
notices first the conscious state of an intention to make a 
bodily movement; then he notices the particular bodily 
movement. At the beginning, because of omission to 
notice an intention, he thinks that bodily movement is 
quicker than the mind knowing it. Now, at this advanced 
stage, mind appears to be the forerunner. The meditator 
readily notices the intention of bending, stretching, sit¬ 
ting, standing, going, and so on. He also clearly notices 
the actual bending, stretching, etc. So he realizes the fact 
that mind knowing a bodily process is quicker than the 
material process. He experiences directly that a bodily 
process takes place after a preceding intention. Again he 
knows from direct experience that the intensity of heat 
or cold increases while he is noticing “hot, hot” or “cold, 
cold.” In contemplating regular and spontaneous bodily 
movements such as the rising and falling of the abdomen, 


26 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


he notices one after another continuously. He also 
notices the arising in him of mental images such as the 
Buddha, an arahat , as well as any kind of sensation that 
arises in his body (such as itch, ache, heat), with atten¬ 
tion directed on the particular spot where the sensation 
occurs. One sensation has hardly disappeared, then 
another arises, and he notices them all accordingly. While 
noticing every object as it arises he is aware that a mental 
process of knowing depends on an object. Sometimes, the 
rising and falling of the abdomen is so faint that he finds 
nothing to notice. Then, it occurs to him that there can 
be no knowing without an object. When no noticing of 
the rising and falling is possible one should be aware of 
sitting and touching or lying and touching. Touching is to 
be noticed alternatively. For example, after noticing “sit¬ 
ting,” notice the touch sensation at the right foot (caused 
by its contact with the ground or seat). Then, after 
noticing “sitting,” notice the touch sensation at the left 
foot. In the same manner, notice the touch sensation at 
several places. Again, in noticing seeing, hearing, the 
meditator comes to know clearly that seeing arises from 
the contact of eye and visual object and hearing arises 
from the contact of ear and sound. 

Further he reflects: “Material processes of bending, 
stretching and so on, follow mental processes of intend¬ 
ing to bend, stretch and so forth.” He goes on to reflect: 
“One’s body becomes hot or cold because of the element 
of heat or cold; the body exists on food and nourish¬ 
ment; consciousness arises because there are objects to 
notice: seeing arises through visual objects; hearing 
through sounds, and also because there are the sense 
organs, eye, ear, etc., as conditioning factors. Intention 
and noticing result from previous experiences; feelings 
(sensations) of all kinds are the consequences of previous 
karma in the sense that material processes and mental 
processes take place ever since birth because of previous 
karma. There is nobody to create this body and mind, 
and all that happens has causal factors.” Such reflections 
come to the meditator while he is noticing any object as 


27 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


it arises. He does not stop doing so to take time to 
reflect. While noticing objects as they arise these reflec¬ 
tions are so quick that they appear to be automatic. The 
meditator, then, must note: “Reflecting, reflecting, 
recognizing, recognizing,” and continue noticing objects 
as usual. After having reflected that material processes 
and mental processes being noticed are conditioned by 
the previous processes of the same nature, the meditator 
reflects further that body and mind in the former exis¬ 
tences were conditioned by the preceding causes, that in 
the following existences body and mind will result from 
the same causes, and apart from this dual process there is 
no separate “being” or “person,” only causes and effects 
taking place. Such reflections must also be noticed and 
then contemplation should go on as usual. 7 Such reflec¬ 
tions will be many in the case of persons with a strong 
intellectual bent and less in the case of those with no 
such bent. Be that as it may, energetic noticing must be 
made of all these reflections. Noticing them will result in 
their reduction to a minimum, allowing insight to pro¬ 
gress unimpeded by an excess of such reflections. It 
should be taken for granted that a minimum of reflec¬ 
tions will suffice here. 

When concentration is practiced in an intensive man¬ 
ner, the meditator may experience almost unbearable 
sensations, such as itching, aches, heat, dullness and stiff¬ 
ness. If mindful noticing is stopped, such sensations will 
disappear. When noticing is resumed, they will reappear. 
Such sensations arise in consequence of the body’s natu¬ 
ral sensitivity and are not the symptoms of a disease. If 
they are noticed with energetic concentration they fade 
away gradually. 

Again, the meditator sometimes sees images of all 
kinds as if seeing them with his own eyes; for example, 
the Buddha comes into the scene in glorious radiance; a 
procession of monks in the sky; pagodas (dagobas) and 
images of the Buddha; meeting with beloved ones; trees 
or woods, hills or mountains, gardens, buildings; finding 
oneself face to face with bloated dead bodies or skele- 


28 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


tons; swelling of one’s body, covered with blood, failing 
into pieces and reduced to a mere skeleton, seeing in 
one’s body the entrails and vital organs and even germs; 
seeing the denizens of the hells and heavens. These are 
nothing but creatures of one’s imagination sharpened by 
intense concentration. They are similar to what one 
comes across in dreams. They are not to be welcomed 
and enjoyed, nor need one be afraid of them. These 
objects seen in the course of contemplation are not real; 
they are mere images or imaginations, whereas the mind 
that sees those objects is a reality. But purely mental 
processes, unconnected with fivefold sense impressions, 
cannot easily be noticed with sufficient clarity and detail. 
Hence principal attention should be given to sense objects 
which can be noticed easily, and to those mental pro¬ 
cesses which arise in connection with sense perceptions. 
So whatever object appears, the meditator shall notice it, 
saying mentally, “seeing, seeing” until it disappears. It 
will either move away, fade away or break asunder. At 
the outset, this will take several noticings, say about five 
to ten. But when insight develops, the object will disap¬ 
pear after a couple of noticings. However, if the medita¬ 
tor wishes to enjoy the sight, or to look closely into the 
matter, or gets scared of it, then it is likely to linger on. If 
the object be one induced deliberately, then through 
delight it will last a long time. So care must be taken not 
to think of or incline towards extraneous matters while 
one’s concentration is good. If such thoughts come in, 
they must be instantly noticed and dispelled. In the case 
of some persons they experience no extraordinary objects 
or feelings and, while contemplating as usual, become 
lazy. They must notice this laziness thus: “lazy, lazy,” 
until they overcome it. At this stage, whether or not the 
meditators come across extraordinary objects or feelings 
they know clearly the initial, the intermediate and the 
final phases of every noticing. At the beginning of the 
practice, while noticing one object, they had to switch 
onto a different object that arose, but they did not notice 
clearly the disappearance of the previous object. Now, 


29 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


only after cognizing the disappearance of an object, they 
notice the new object that arises. Thus they have a clear 
knowledge of the initial, the intermediate and the final 
phases of the object noticed. 

At this stage when the meditator becomes more prac¬ 
ticed he perceives in every act of noticing that an object 
appears suddenly and disappears instantly. His perception 
is so clear that he reflects thus: “All comes to an end; all 
disappears. Nothing is permanent; it is truly imperma¬ 
nent.” His reflection is quite in line with what is stated in 
the Commentary to the Pali Text: “All is impermanent, 
in the sense of destruction, nonexistence after having 
been.” He reflects further: “It is through ignorance that 
we enjoy life. But in truth, there is nothing to enjoy. 
There is a continuous arising and disappearing by which 
we are harassed ever and anon. This is dreadful indeed. At 
any moment we may die and everything is sure to come 
to an end. This universal impermanence is truly frightful 
and terrible.” His reflection agrees with the commentarial 
statement: “What is^permanent is painful, painful in the 
sense of terror; painful because of oppression by rise and 
fall.” Again, experiencing severe pains he reflects thus: 
“All is pain, all is bad.” This reflection agrees with what 
the Commentary states: “He looks on pain as a barb; as a 
boil; as a dart.” He further reflects: “This is a mass of 
suffering, suffering that is unavoidable. Arising and disap¬ 
pearing, it is worthless. One cannot stop its process. It is 
beyond one’s power. It takes its natural course.” This 
reflection is quite in agreement with the Commentary; 
“What is painful is not self, not self in the sense of having 
no core, because there is no exercising of power over it.” 
The meditator must notice all these reflections and go on 
contemplating as usual. 

Having thus seen the three characteristics by direct 
experience, the meditator, by inference from the direct 
experience of the objects noticed, comprehends all the 
objects not yet noticed as being impermanent, subject to 
suffering, and without a self. 

In respect of objects not personally experienced, he 


30 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


concludes: ‘They too are constituted in the same way: 
impermanent, painful and without a self.” This is an 
inference from his present direct experience. Such a com¬ 
prehension is not clear enough in the case of one with less 
intellectual capacity or limited knowledge who pays no 
attention to a reflection but simply goes on noticing 
objects. But such a comprehension occurs often to one 
who yields to reflection, which, in some cases, may occur 
at every act of noticing. Such excessive reflecting, how¬ 
ever, is an impediment to the progress of insight. Even if 
no such reflections occur at this stage, comprehension 
will nevertheless become increasingly clear at the higher 
stages. Hence, no attention should be given to reflections. 
While giving more attention to the bare noticing of 
objects, the meditator must, however, also notice these 
reflections if they occur, but he should not dwell on 
them. 8 

After comprehending the three characteristics, the 
meditator no longer reflects but goes on with noticing 
those bodily and mental objects which present themselves 
continuously. Then at the moment when the five mental 
faculties, namely, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentra¬ 
tion, and knowledge, are properly balanced, the mental 
process of noticing accelerates as if it becomes uplifted, 
and the bodily and mental processes to be noticed also 
arise much quicker. In a moment of in-breathing the 
rising of the abdomen presents itself in quick succession, 
and the falling also becomes correspondingly quicker. 
Quick succession is also evident in the process of bending 
and stretching. Slight movements are felt spreading all 
over the body. In several cases, prickly sensations and 
itching appear in quick succession momentarily. By and 
large, these are feelings hard to bear. The meditator can¬ 
not possibly keep pace with that quick succession - of 
varied experiences if he attempts to notice them by 
name. Noticing has here to be done in a general manner, 
but with mindfulness. At this stage one need not try to 
notice details of the objects arising in quick succession, 
but one should notice them generally. If one wishes to 


31 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


name them, a collective designation will be sufficient. If 
one attempts to follow them in a detailed manner, one 
will get tired soon. The important thing is to notice 
clearly and to comprehend what arises. At this stage, the 
usual contemplation focused on a few selected objects 
should be set aside and mindful noticing should attend to 
every object that arises at the six sense doors. Only when 
one is not keen on this sort of noticing, then one should 
revert to the usual contemplation. 

Bodily and mental processes are many times swifter 
than a wink of an eye or a flash of lightning. Yet, if the 
meditator goes on simply noticing these processes he can 
fully comprehend them as they happen. Then mindful¬ 
ness becomes very strong. As a result, mindfulness seems 
as if plunging into an object that arises. The object too 
seems as if alighting on mindfulness. One comprehends 
each object clearly and singly. Therefore the meditator 
then believes: “Bodily and mental processes are very 
swift indeed. They are as fast as a machine or an engine. 
And yet, they all can be noticed and comprehended. 
Perhaps there is nothing more to know. What is to be 
known has been known.” He believes so because he knows 
by direct experience what he has not even dreamt of 
before. 

Again, as a result of insight, a brilliant light will appear 
to the meditator. There arises also in him rapture, causing 
“goose flesh,” falling of tears, tremor in the limbs. It 
produces in him a subtle thrill and exhilaration. He feels 
as if on a swing. He even wonders whether he is just 
giddy. Then, there arises tranquility of mind and along 
with it appears mental agility. When sitting,, lying, walk¬ 
ing or standing, he feels quite at ease. Both body and 
mind are agile in functioning swiftly, they are pliant in 
being able to attend to any object desired; they are 
wieldy in being able to attend to an object for any length 
of time desired. One is free from stiffness, heat or pain. 
Insight penetrates objects with ease. Mind becomes sound 
and straight, and one wishes to avoid all evil. Through 
firm faith, mind is very bright. At times, when there is no 


32 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


object to be noticed, the mind remains tranquil for a long 
time. There arise in him thoughts like these: “Verily, the 
Buddha is omniscient. Truly, the body-and-mind process 
is impermanent, painful and without self.” While noticing 
objects he comprehends lucidly the three characteristics. 
He wishes to advise others to practice meditation. Free 
from sloth and torpor, his energy is neither lax nor tense. 
There also arises in him equanimity associated with 
insight. His happiness exceeds his former experiences. So 
he wishes to communicate his feelings and experiences to 
others. There arises further a subtle attachment of a calm 
nature that enjoys the insight associated with the brilliant 
light, mindfulness and rapture. He comes to believe it to 
be just the bliss of meditation. 

The meditator should not reflect on these happenings. 
As each arises, he should notice them accordingly: “Bril¬ 
liant light, faith, rapture, tranquility, happiness and so 
on .” 9 When there is brightness, one should notice it as 
“bright,” until it disappears. Similar acts of noticing 
should be made in the other cases too. When brilliant 
light appears, at the beginning one tends to forget notic¬ 
ing and enjoys seeing the light. Even if the meditator 
applies mindful noticing to the light, it will be mixed 
with feelings of rapture and happiness, and it is likely to 
linger on. However, one later gets used to such phenom¬ 
ena and one will continue to notice them clearly until 
they disappear. Sometimes the light is so brilliant that 
one finds it difficult to make it vanish by the mere act of 
noticing it mindfully. Then one should cease to pay 
attention to it and turn energetically to the noticing of 
any object that arises in one’s body. The meditator 
should not ponder as to whether the light is still there. If 
he does so, he is likely to see it. If such a thought arises, 
he should disperse it by vigorously directing his attention 
to that very thought. While concentration is intense, not 
only a brilliant light but also several other extraordinary 
objects arise and may continue if one inclines to one or 
the other of them. If such inclination happens to arise, 
the meditator must notice it quickly. In some cases, even 


33 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


if there is no such inclination towards any object in 
particular, faint objects appear one after the other like a 
train of railway carriages. The meditator should then 
respond to such visual images simply by “seeing, seeing,” 
and each object will disappear. When the meditator’s 
insight becomes weaker, the objects may become more 
distinct. Then, each of them must be noticed until the 
whole train of objects disappears finally. 

One must recognize the fact that cherishing an inclina¬ 
tion towards such phenomena as a brilliant light, and 
being attached to them, is a wrong attitude. The correct 
response that is in conformity with the path of insight is 
to notice these objects mindfully and with detachment 
until they disappear . 10 When the meditator continues to 
apply mindfulness to body-and-mind, his insight will 
grow in clarity. He will come to perceive more distinctly 
the arising and disappearing of the bodily and mental 
processes. He will come to know that each object arises at 
one place and on the very place it disappears. He will 
know that the previous occurrence is one thing and the 
succeeding occurrence is another. So, at every act of 
noticing, he comprehends the characteristics of imperma¬ 
nence, painfulness and egolessness. After thus contem¬ 
plating for a considerable time, he may come to believe: 
“This is surely the best that can be attained. It can’t be 
better.” He becomes so satisfied with his progress that he 
is likely to pause and relax. He should, however, not relax 
at this stage, but go ahead with his practice of noticing 
the bodily and mental processes continuously for a still 
longer time . 11 

With the improvement of practice and when know¬ 
ledge becomes more mature, the arising of the objects is 
no longer apparent to the meditator; he notices only their 
ceasing. They pass away swiftly. So also do the mental 
processes of noticing them. For instance, while noticing 
the rising of the abdomen, that movement vanishes in no 
time. And in the same manner vanishes the mental pro¬ 
cess of noticing that movement. Thus it will be clearly 
known to the meditator that both the rising and the 


34 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


noticing vanish immediately, one after another. The same 
applies in the case of the falling of the abdomen, of 
sitting, bending or stretching of an arm or leg, stiffness in 
the limbs, and so on. The noticing of an object and the 
knowledge of its ceasing occur in quick succession. Some 
meditators perceive distinctly three phases: noticing an 
object, its ceasing, and the passing away of the conscious¬ 
ness that cognizes that ceasing—all in quick succession. 
However, it is sufficient to know, in pairwise sequence, 
the dissolution of an object and the passing away of the 
consciousness of noticing that dissolution. 

When a meditator can clearly notice these pairs unin¬ 
terruptedly, the particular features such as body, head, 
hand, leg are no longer apparent to him, and there 
appears to him the idea that everything is ceasing and 
vanishing. At this stage he is likely to feel that his 
contemplation is not up to the mark. But in fact, it is not 
so. Mind as a rule takes delight in dwelling on the sight of 
particular features and forms. Because of their absence, 
mind is wanting in satisfaction. As a matter of fact, it is 
the manifestation of the progress of insight. At the begin¬ 
ning, it is features that are clearly noticed first, but now 
their ceasing is noticed first, because of the progress. 
Only on repeated reflection, features appear again, but if 
they are not noticed the fact of dissolution reappears to 
remain. So one comes to know by direct experience the 
truth of the wise saying: “When a name or designation 
arises, a reality lies hidden; when a reality reveals itself, a 
name or designation disappears.” 

When the meditator notices the objects clearly, he 
thinks that his noticings are not close enough. In fact, the 
insight is so swift and clear that he comes to know even 
the momentary subconsciousness in between the pro¬ 
cesses of cognition. He intends to do something, for 
instance, bending or stretching an arm, and he readily 
notices that intention which thereby tends to fade away, 
with the result that he cannot bend or stretch for some 
time. In that event, he should switch his attention to 
contemplating the occurrences at one of the six sense 


35 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


doors. 

If the meditator extends his contemplation over the 
whole body, as usual, beginning with the noticing of the 
rising and the falling of the abdomen, he will soon gain 
momentum, and then he should continue noticing touch¬ 
ing and knowing, or seeing and knowing, or hearing and 
knowing and so on, as one or the other occurs. While so 
doing, if he feels that he is either restless or tired, then he 
should revert to noticing the rising and falling of the 
abdomen. After some time, when he gains momentum, 
he should notice any object that arises in the whole body. 

When he can contemplate well in such a spread out 
manner, even if he does not notice an object with vigor, 
he knows what he hears fades away, what he sees dis¬ 
solves in broken parts, with no continuation between 
them. This is seeing things as they really are. Some 
meditators do not see clearly what is happening because 
the vanishing is so swift that they feel their eyesight is 
getting poorer or they are giddy. It is not so. They are 
simply lacking the power of cognition to notice what 
happens before and after, with the result that they do not 
see the features or forms. At such a time, they should 
relax and stop contemplating. But the bodily- and mental 
processes continue to appear to them, and consciousness, 
of its own accord, continues to notice them. The medi¬ 
tator may decide to sleep, but he does not fall asleep; and 
yet he remains fit and alert. He need not worry about the 
loss of sleep, because on this account he will not feel 
unwell or fall ill. He should go ahead with noticing 
energetically and he will feel that his mind is quite 
capable to perceive the objects fully and clearly. 

When engaged in noticing continuously both the disso¬ 
lution of the objects and the act of knowing it, he 
reflects: “Even for the wink of an eye or a flash of 
lightning nothing lasts. One did not realize this before. As 
it ceased and vanished in the past so will it cease and 
vanish in the future.” One must notice such a reflec¬ 
tion . 12 Besides, in the midst of contemplations, the med¬ 
itator is likely to have an awareness of fearfulness. He 


36 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


reflects: “One enjoys life, not knowing the truth. Now 
that one knows the truth of continuous dissolution it is 
truly fearful. At every moment of dissolution one can 
die. The beginning of this life itself is fearful. So are the 
endless repetitions of the arisings. Fearful it is to feel that 
in the absence of real features and forms the arisings 
appear to be real. So are the efforts to arrest the changing 
phenomena for the sake of well-being and happiness. To 
be reborn is fearful in that it will be a recurrence of 
objects that are ceasing and vanishing always. Fearful 
indeed it is to be old, to die, to experience sorrow, 
lamentation, pain, grief and despair.” Such reflection 
should be noticed and then dismissed. 

Then the meditator sees nothing to depend on and 
becomes as it were weakened in mind as well as in body. 
He is seized with dejection. He is no longer bright and 
spirited. But he should not despair. This condition of his 
is a sign of the progress of insight. It is nothing more than 
being unhappy at the awareness of fearfulness. He must 
notice such a reflection and as he continues to notice 
objects as they arise, one after another, this unhappy 
feeling will disappear soon. However, if he fails to con¬ 
template for some time, then grief will assert itself and 
fear will overpower him. This kind of fear is not associ¬ 
ated with insight. Therefore, care must be taken to pre¬ 
vent the oncoming of such undesirable fear by energetic 
contemplation . 13 

Again in the midst of noticing objects, he is likely to 
find faults, in this manner: ‘This body-and-mind process, 
being impermanent, is unsatisfactory. It was not a good 
thing to have been born. It is not good either to continue 
in existence. It is disappointing to see the appearance of 
seemingly definite features and forms of objects while in 
fact they are not realities. It is in vain that one makes 
efforts to seek well-being and happiness. Birth is not 
desirable. Dreadful are old age, death, lamentation, pain, 
grief and despair.” A reflection of this nature must like¬ 
wise be noticed . 14 

Then, one tends to feel that body-and-mind as the 


37 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


object and the consciousness of noticing it are very crude, 
low or worthless. By noticing their arising and disappear¬ 
ing he gets sick of them. He might see his own body 
decaying and decomposing. He looks upon it as being 
very fragile. 

At this stage, while the meditator is noticing all that 
arises in his body and mind he is getting disgusted with it. 
Although he cognizes clearly their dissolution by a series 
of good noticings he is no longer alert and bright. His 
contemplation is associated with disgust. So he becomes 
lazy to contemplate. But nevertheless he cannot refrain 
from contemplating. For example, it is like one who feels 
disgusted at every step when he has to walk on a muddy 
and dirty path and yet he cannot stop going. He cannot 
help but go on. At this time, he sees the human abode as 
being subject to the process of dissolution, and he does 
not relish the prospect of being reborn as a human being, 
man or woman, king or multimillionaire. He has the same 
feelings towards the celestial abodes . 15 

When through this knowledge he feels disgusted with 
regard to every formation noticed, there will arise in him 
a desire to forsake these formations or be delivered from 
them . 16 Seeing, hearing, touching, reflecting, standing, 
sitting, bending, stretching, noticing—he wishes to get rid 
of them all. He should notice this wishing. He now longs 
for the liberation from bodily and mental processes. He 
reflects: “Every time I notice them, I am meeting with 
repetitions, which are all bad. I had better stop noticing 
them.” He should take notice of such a reflection. 

Some meditators, when so reflecting, actually stop 
noticing the formations. Although they do so, the forma¬ 
tions do not stop taking place, namely, rising, falling, 
bending, stretching, intending and so on. They go on as 
ever. Noticing of the distinct formations also continues. 
So, reflecting thus, he feels pleased: “Although I stop 
noticing the body-and-mind, formations are taking place 
all the same. They are arising, and consciousness of them 
is there, by itself. So liberation from them cannot be 
achieved by mere stopping to notice them. They cannot 


38 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


be forsaken in this way. Noticing them as usual, the three 
characteristics of life will be fully comprehended and 
then no heed being given to them, equanimity will be 
gained. The end of these formations, nirvana, will be 
realized. Peace and bliss will come.” So reflecting with 
delight, he continues to notice the formations. In the case 
of those meditators who are not capable of reflecting in 
this way, they continue their meditation once they 
become satisfied with the explanation of their teachers. 

Soon after continuing meditation they gain momen¬ 
tum and at that time usually various painful feelings arise 
in some cases. This need not cause despair. It is only the 
manifestation of the characteristic inherent in this mass 
of suffering, as stated in the Commentary thus: “Seeing 
the five aggregates as painful, as a disease, a boil, as a 
dart, a calamity, an affliction, etc.” If such painful feel¬ 
ings are not experienced, one of the forty characteristics 
of impermanence, suffering or no-self 17 will be apparent 
at every noticing. Although the meditator is properly 
noticing he feels that he is not doing well. He thinks that 
the consciousness of noticing and the object noticed are 
not close enough. This is because he is too eager to 
comprehend fully the nature of the three characteristics. 
Not satisfied with his contemplation he changes his pos¬ 
ture often. While sitting, he thinks he will do better 
walking. While walking he wants to resume sitting. After 
he has sat down he changes the position of his limbs. He 
wants to go to another place; he wants to lie down. 
Although he makes these changes he cannot remain long 
in one particular position. Again, he becomes restless. But 
he should not despair. All this happens because he has 
come to realize the true nature of the formations, and 
also because he has not yet acquired the “knowledge of 
equanimity about formations.” He is doing well and yet 
he feels otherwise. He should try to adhere to one pos¬ 
ture, and he will find that he is comfortable in that 
posture. Continuing to notice the formations energeti¬ 
cally, his mind will gradually become composed and 
bright. In the end his restless feelings will disappear 


39 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


totally . 18 

When the “knowledge of equanimity about forma¬ 
tions” becomes mature, the mind will be very clear and 
able to notice the formations very lucidly. Noticing runs 
smoothly as if no effort is required. Subtle formations, 
too, are noticed without effort. The true characteristics 
of impermanence, pain and no-self are becoming evident 
without any reflection. Attention is directed to a particu¬ 
lar spot at any part of the body wherever a sensation 
occurs, but the feeling of touch is as smooth as that of 
cotton. Sometimes, the objects to be noticed in the 
whole body are so many that noticing has to be acceler¬ 
ated. Both body and mind appear to be pulling upwards. 
The objects being noticed become sparse and one can 
notice them easily and calmly. Sometimes the bodily 
formations disappear altogether leaving only the mental 
formations. Then the meditator will experience within 
himself a feeling of rapture as if enjoying a shower of tiny 
particles of water. He is also suffused with serenity. He 
might also see brightness like a clear sky. These marked 
experiences, however, do not influence him excessively. 
He is not overjoyed. But he still enjoys them. He must 
notice this enjoyment. He must also notice rapture, seren¬ 
ity and bright light. If they do not vanish when being 
noticed, he should pay no heed to them and notice any 
other object that arises. 

At this stage he becomes satisfied with the knowledge 
that there is no I, mine, he or his, and that only forma¬ 
tions arise; formations only, are cognizing formations. He 
also finds delight in noticing the objects one after 
another. He is not tired of noticing the objects one after 
another. He is not tired of noticing them for a long time. 
He is free from painful feelings. So whatever posture he 
chooses he can retain it long. Either sitting or lying he 
can go on contemplating for two or three hours without 
experiencing any discomfort, spending his time tirelessly. 
Intending to contemplate for a while, he may go on for 
two or three hours. Even after that time his posture is as 
firm as before.

At times formations arise swiftly and he is noticing 
them well. Then he may become anxious as to what 
would happen to him. He should notice such an anxiety. 
He feels he is doing well. He should notice this feeling. He 
looks forward to the progress of insight. He should notice 
this anticipation. He should notice steadily whatever 
arises. He should not put forth a special effort nor relax. 
In some cases, because of the anxiety, joy, attachment or 
anticipation, noticing becomes lax and retrogressive. 
Some who think that the goal is very near contemplate 
with great energy. While doing so, noticing becomes lax 
and retrogression sets in. This happens because a restless 
mind cannot concentrate properly on formations. So 
when noticing is in good swing the meditator must go on 
steadily; that means he should neither relax nor put forth 
special effort. If he does go on steadily, he will rapidly 
gain insight into the end of all the formations and realize 
nirvana. In the case of some meditators, they may, at this 
stage, rise higher and again fall several times. They should 
not give way to despair but instead hold fast to determin¬ 
ation. Heed must be paid also to noticing whatever arises 
at all the six sense doors. However, when noticing is going 
on smoothly and calmly, contemplation in such a spread 
out manner is not possible. So this manner of noticing 
should begin with the gaining of the momentum in con¬ 
templation until it becomes smooth and calm. 

If the meditator begins either with the rising and 
falling of the abdomen or with any other bodily and 
mental object, he will find that he is gaining momentum. 
And then the noticing will go on of its own accord 
smoothly and calmly. It will appear to him that he is 
watching with ease the ceasing and vanishing of the 
formations in a clear manner. At this point, his mind is 
quite free from all the defilements. However pleasant and 
inviting an object may be, it is no longer so to him. 
Again, however loathsome an object may be, it is no 
longer so to him. He simply sees, hears, smells, tastes, 
feels a touch or cognizes. With six kinds of equanimity 
described in the Texts he notices all the formations. He is 


41 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


not even aware of the length of time he is engaged in 
contemplation. Nor does he reflect in any manner. But if 
he does not develop sufficient progress of insight to gain 
the “knowledge of the path and its fruition "(magga and 
phala) within two or three hours, concentration becomes 
slack and reflection sets in. On the other hand, if he is 
making good progress he may anticipate further advance. 
He will become so delighted with the result that he will 
experience a fall. Then he must dispel such an anticipa¬ 
tion or reflection by directing bare noticing to it. A 
steady contemplation will achieve smooth progress again. 
But if sufficient strength of insight has not yet been 
achieved, concentration becomes slack again. In this way, 
some meditators progress and fall back several times. 
Those who are acquainted with the stages of the progress 
of insight by way of study (or by hearing about them) 
encounter such ups and downs. Hence it is not good for a 
pupil who meditates under the guidance of a teacher to 
get acquainted with these stages before meditation 
begins. But for the benefit of those who have to practice 
without the guidance of an experienced teacher, these 
stages have been indicated here. 

In spite of such fluctuations in his progress the medi¬ 
tator must not allow himself to be overcome by disap¬ 
pointment or despair. He is now, as it were, at the 
threshold of magga and phala (the entry and the fruition 
of the stages of sainthood). As soon as the five faculties 
(indriya) of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and 
wisdom are developed in an even manner, he will soon 
reach magga and phala and realize nirvana.

How Nirvana is Realized 


The ups and downs of insight knowledge occurring in 
the aforesaid manner are comparable to a bird let loose 
from a sea-going ship. In ancient times the captain of a 
sea-going ship, finding it difficult to know whether the 
ship was approaching land, released a bird that he had 
taken with him. The bird flies in all four directions to 
look for a shore. Whenever it cannot find any land, it 
comes back to the ship. As long as insight knowledge is 
not mature enough to grow into path and fruition know¬ 
ledge and thereby attain to the realization of nirvana, it 
becomes lax and retarded, just as the bird returns to the 
ship. When the bird sees land, it flies on in that direction 
without returning to the ship. Similarly, when insight 
knowledge is mature, on having become keen, strong and 
lucid, it will understand one of the formations, at one of 
the six sense doors, as being impermanent or painful or 
without self. That act of noticing any one characteristic 
out of the three which has a higher degree of lucidity and 
strength in its perfect understanding, becomes faster and 
manifests itself three or four times in rapid succession. 
Immediately after the last consciousness in this series of 
accelerated noticing has ceased, magga and phala (path 
and fruition) arises, realizing nirvana, the cessation of all 
formations. 

The acts of noticing are now more lucid than the 
previous ones immediately before the realization. After 
the last act of noticing, the cessation of the formations 
and realization of nirvana become manifest. That is why 


43 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


those who have realized nirvana would say: 

The objects noticed and the consciousness notic¬ 
ing them cease altogether; or, the objects and the 
acts of noticing are cut off as a vine is cut by a 
knife; or, the objects and acts of noticing fall off as 
if one is relieved of a heavy load; or, the objects and 
acts of noticing break away as if something one is 
holding breaks asunder; or, the objects and acts of 
noticing are suddenly freed as if from a prison; or, 
the objects and acts of noticing are blown off as if a 
candle is suddenly extinguished; or, they disappear 
as if darkness is suddenly replaced by light; or, they 
are released as if freed from an embroilment; or, 
they sink as if in water, or abruptly stop as if a 
person running were stopped by a violent push; or, 
they cease altogether. 

The duration of realizing the cessation of formations 
is, however, not long. It is so short that it lasts just for an 
instant of noticing. Then the meditator reviews what has 
occurred. He knows that the cessation of the material 
processes noticed and the mental processes noticing them 
is the realization of magga-phala-nirvana. Those who are 
well-informed know that the cessation of the formations 
is nirvana , and the realization of cessation and bliss is 
maggaphala. They would say inwardly: “I have now 
realized nirvana and have attained sotapatti maggaphala. ” 
Such a clear knowledge is evident to one who has studied 
the scriptures or heard sermons on this subject . 19 

Some meditators review defilements—those already 
abandoned and those remaining to be abandoned. After 
having reviewed in this way, they still continue the prac¬ 
tice of noticing bodily and mental processes. While doing 
so, the bodily and mental processes, however, appear to 
be coarse. Both the arising and the passing away of the 
processes are clearly evident to the meditator. And yet 
the meditator now feels as if his noticing is lax and has 
regressed. As a matter of fact he has come back to the 
knowledge of arising and passing away. It is true, his 
noticing has become lax and regressed. Because he has 
come back to this stage, he is likely to see bright lights or 
shapes of objects. In some cases, this reversion results in 


44 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


unbalanced contemplation in that the objects noticed and 
acts of noticing do not go together. Some meditators 
experience slight pain for a while. By and large, the 
meditators notice that their mental processes are clear 
and bright. At this stage, the meditator feels that his 
mind is absolutely free from any encumbrance; he feels 
happily unhindered. In such a frame of mind he cannot 
notice the mental process, and even if he does so, he 
cannot notice it distinctly. He cannot think of any other 
thing either. He simply feels bright and blissful. When this 
feeling loses its vigor he can again notice the bodily and 
mental processes and know their arising and passing away 
clearly. After some time he reaches the stage where he 
can notice the formations smoothly and calmly. Then, if 
the insight knowledge is mature, he can again attain to 
the “knowledge of the cessation of the formations.” If 
the power of concentration is keen and firm, then such 
knowledge can repeat itself frequently. In these times, 
the object of the meditators is to attain to the knowledge 
of the first magga-phala, and consequently they regain 
that knowledge repeatedly. Thus far has been described 
the method of meditation, the progressive stages of 
insight knowledge and the realization of sotapatti magga- 
phala. 

One who has attained the knowledge of path and 
fruition is aware of the distinct change of his tempera¬ 
ment and mental attitude and feels that his life has 
changed. His faith or trustful confidence in the three 
sacred gems becomes very strong and firm. Due to this 
strengthened faith he also gains in rapture and serenity. 
There arises in him a spontaneous upsurge of happiness. 
Because of these ecstatic experiences he cannot notice 
the objects in a distinct manner although he endeavors to 
do so right after the attainment of magga-phala. However, 
these experiences wane gradually after some hours or 
days, and he will then be able again to notice the forma¬ 
tions distinctly. In some cases, the meditators, having 
attained magga-phala , feel relieved of a great burden, free 
and easy, and do not wish to go on contemplating. Their 


45 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


object, the attainment of magga-phala, has been achieved 
and their hearts’ content is understandable. 

Fruition Knowledge (Phala-nana) If one who has 

attained magga-phala wishes to attain the knowledge of 
fruition (phala-riana) and nirvana once again, he must 
direct his mind towards that goal and again attend to 
noticing mindfully the bodily and mental processes. In 
the course of insight meditation it is but natural that 
“analytical knowledge of body and mind” appears first to 
a worldling (puthujjana) and “knowledge of arising and 
passing away” appears first to a noble person (ariya). 
Therefore, a meditator at this stage, conscious of the 
bodily and mental processes, will forthwith achieve the 
“knowledge of arising and passing away,” followed soon 
by the other progressive stages of insight, up to the 
“knowledge of equanimity about formations.” When this 
knowledge matures, the cessation of formations, nirvana, 
is reached with the resultant “knowledge of fruition.” 
This knowledge lasts just a moment to one who has not 
previously made a resolve on its duration; but it may 
sometimes last a little longer. But in the case of those 
who had made a prior resolve on its duration, the “know¬ 
ledge of fruition” lasts longer, say the whole day or night, 
or as long as the time resolved, as stated in the Commen¬ 
taries. Likewise, in these days, in the case of those 
immersed in concentration and insight, fruition lasts an 
hour, two hours, three hours, and so on. Fruition know¬ 
ledge comes to an end only when the meditator wishes to 
terminate it. Nevertheless, during a period of fruition 
knowledge, lasting an hour or two, reflective moments 
sometimes arise, but they disappear after four or five 
noticings, and fruition knowledge recurs. In some cases, 
fruition knowledge lasts for several hours, without any 
interruption. While fruition knowledge lasts, conscious¬ 
ness is absolutely set upon the cessation of formations 
known by the designation of nirvana. Nirvana is a dharma 
entirely liberated from the bodily and mental process and 
all mundane notions. Therefore, during the experiencing 


46 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


of fruition knowledge there arises no awareness of one’s 
bodily and mental processes and of this world, nor of any 
other mundane sphere. One is absolutely free from the 
entire mundane sphere. One is absolutely free from all 
mundane knowledge and inclinations. There are around 
him all objects to see, hear, smell or touch, but he is not 
aware of them at all. His posture is firm. If bliss of 
fruition knowledge comes while he is sitting, his sitting 
posture remains firm, as firm as before, without bending 
or sagging. However, when the process of fruition know¬ 
ledge comes to an end there arises at once in him the 
awareness of thoughts relating to the cessation of the 
formations or the objects of sight, hearing, etc. Then the 
normal contemplation returns or buoyant feeling or 
reflection. At the beginning the formations appear to him 
to be coarse and his noticings are not vigorous enough. 
But in the case of those who are strong in insight, their 
contemplation runs as smoothly as ever. 

A note of warning may be given here. The meditator 
should make a prior resolve on the speedy entrance into 
fruition knowledge and the duration of it. He should not 
turn his attention to a resolve once he has started to 
notice the bodily and mental processes. Before the matur¬ 
ity of insight is achieved, while he is doing very well in 
noticing the formations, he may experience "goose- 
flesh,” yawning, trembling and sobbing, and lose the 
momentum of contemplation. While the acts of noticing 
are gaining strength, he may look forward to the goal and 
thereby loosen the grip on his contemplation. But he 
should not think of anything else than his contemplation 
and if he does so unwittingly, he must notice the extrane¬ 
ous thought. Some attain to fruition knowledge only 
after several losses of the momentum in their acts of 
noticing. If one’s concentration is weak, then the entry 
into fruition knowledge is slow, and when it comes it 
does not last long. This is a description of the process of 
fruition knowledge. 

Reviewing Some of the meditators pass through the 


47 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


stages of the knowledge of fearfulness, misery, disgust, 
desire of deliverance and consequently have no clear view 
of them. So, one wishing to review them should review 
each of them for a fixed time. For example, for half an 
hour or one hour one should pay heed only to the arising 
and passing away of the objects, with a resolve on the 
knowledge of arising and passing away. During that per¬ 
iod the knowledge of arising and passing away remains 
intact, and there will be no further progress of insight. 
However, when that period expires, knowledge of dissolu¬ 
tion arises by itself. If it does not arise by itself, then 
heed must be given to dissolution with a resolve that 
knowledge of dissolution stays on for a certain length of 
time. During that period what has been resolved will 
occur. On the expiration of the time fixed, the next 
higher knowledge will arise by itself. If it does not, he 
should aspire to the knowledge of fearfulness associated 
with fearful objects. Then knowledge of fearfulness will 
come together with fearful objects. Then he should turn 
his attention to miserable objects and knowledge of mis¬ 
ery will arise very soon. When the mind is directed to 
disgusting objects it will give rise to knowledge of disgust. 
Getting disgusted with every noticing, knowledge of dis¬ 
gust will set in. The next stage must then be thought of: 
knowledge of desire for deliverance. Seized with an 
ardent desire to be delivered from the formations, he 
should aspire to the relevant knowledge, and soon that 
knowledge will come, after some effort. When one 
inclines towards the next higher stage, one will experi¬ 
ence pains, wish to change postures and become dis¬ 
turbed by a feeling of dissatisfaction, but will gain know¬ 
ledge of reobservation. Then, the meditator must turn his 
mind to the knowledge of equanimity. The momentum 
of contemplation will go on until there arises smoothly 
the knowledge of reobservation. In this way, one will find 
that during the stipulated time, while one is noticing, the 
particular knowledge one aspires to arises and on its 
expiration the next higher knowledge arises as if it were a 
barometric rise. If a review of the above-mentioned 


48 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


knowledges is not yet satisfactory, it should be repeated 
until one is satisfied. To a very ardent meditator the 
progress is so very swift that he may reach the stage of 
knowledge of equanimity about formations in a few' 
moments, as also the stage of fruition knowledge. One 
who is well matured in the practice can attain to fruition 
knowledge while walking or having a meal. 

How to Attain to the Higher Paths (Maggas) 

When the meditator gets full satisfaction from the 
exercises to attain speedily the fruition knowledge of trie 
first path, as also to abide therein for a long time, he 
should strive to attain to a higher path. He must then 
make an ardent wish in this manner, having determined a 
definite period for striving: “During this period I do not 
wish to experience the fruition knowledge. May there be 
no recurrence of that knowledge! May 1 attain to the 
higher path, the path I have not yet attained! May I reach 
that goal!” With this ardent wish, he should, as usual, 
notice the bodily and mental processes. The advantage of 
the determination of a definite period is that he can 
easily attain again the fruition knowledge of the path 
already acquired, if he so wishes. If no such time limit is 
made, and one goes on striving to attain to the higher 
path, then it will no longer be possible for him to attain 
again the fruition knowledge of the lower path. In that 
event, if one finds that he cannot as yet attain to the 
higher path nor go back to the fruition knowledge of the 
lower path, he will be disturbed by a feeling of dissatis¬ 
faction and disappointment. The advantage of abandon¬ 
ing the wish for re-attaining the already attained fruition 
knowledge is the nonattainment of the knowledge during 
the particular period, and if there is maturity of insight, 
one can attain to the higher path. If the wish is not fully 
abandoned, then the previous fruition knowledge may set 
in again. Therefore, full abandonment of the wish is 
called for during the definite period. When one begins the 
contemplation with a view to attaining the higher path, 
the progress of insight will begin with knowledge of 


49 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


arising and passing away. Then the progress of insight is 
not similar to that one makes while striving for the 
recurrence of fruition knowledge, but the same as the 
progress one makes in practicing contemplation for the 
lower path. Brilliant light or shapes may appear as in the 
case of the earlier stage of knowledge of arising and 
passing away. One may experience pain. Distinct arising 
and passing away of the bodily and mental processes 
occurs. Although it does not take long to regain the 
“knowledge of equanimity about formations” while one 
is contemplating for the recurrence of fruition know¬ 
ledge, now if insight does not mature one will have to 
remain long at the stages of lower knowledges. However, 
no difficulty will confront the meditator as in the case of 
his contemplation for the lower path. It is possible that 
he may attain to one knowledge after another up to 
“knowledge of equanimity about formations” in a day’s 
time. The mental process of knowledge is much more 
lucid, distinct and broad. Much keener are his experiences 
of fearfulness, misery, disgust, desire for deliverance from 
the ills of the mundane spheres. Formerly, although it 
was possible to attain fruition knowledge four or five 
times in an hour, now, if insight is not yet mature for the 
higher path, “knowledge of equanimity about forma¬ 
tions” goes on. Possibly it may last from a day to months 
or years. On the maturity of insight, distinct noticings of 
the formations having appeared, the realization of the 
cessation of the formations comes with the attainment of 
the higher path and fruition. Then will come to him the 
“knowledge of reviewing.” He will later return to the 
stage of “knowledge of arising and passing away” with a 
very clear mental process. This is the description of the 
progress of insight leading to the attainment of saka- 
dagami magga , the path of the once-returner. 

Again, if one ardently wishes to attain to the third 
path, anagami magga, one must again decide on a definite 
period during which one abandons fully the desire for 
returning to the fruition knowledge of the previous path. 
Then one resolves thus: “May only the progress of insight 


50 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


relating to the higher path come. May I attain the higher 
path and fruition.” And he must begin contemplating on 
body and mind as usual. He begins with '‘knowledge of 
arising and passing away,” but soon he will attain the 
higher knowledges one after the other up to “knowledge 
of equanimity about formations.” If insight is not yet 
mature, then that knowledge will linger on. When it 
matures, then it will reach the cessation of formations 
and with it the knowledge of the third path and fruition. 
This is the description of the attainment of the third path 
and fruition, of the anagami or nonreturner. 

One who aspires to the fourth and final path and 
fruition, that of sainthood (arahatta magga and phala), 
must fix a period and give up all desire to re-attain to the 
fruition-knowledge of the third path. Then he must begin 
to contemplate the bodily and mental processes as usual. 
This is the only way, as stated in the Satipatthana Sutra. 
Beginning with “knowledge of arising and passing away,” 
soon “knowledge of equanimity about formations” will 
be attained. If insight is not yet mature, it will tarry. 
When it does mature, then the meditator will attain to 
the cessation of formations with the realization of the 
final arahatta magga. 

In the foregoing paragraphs, the words to the effect 
that the progress of insight will end up in the realization 
of the knowledge of the paths and fruitions (magga- 
phala-nana) refer only to those who have gained maturity 
in the fulfilment of paramitas (perfections). Those who 
have not yet developed paramitas fully will come to a 
standstill at the “knowledge of equanimity about forma¬ 
tions.” An important point to be noted is that, although 
the person who has attained the first path is likely to 
attain the second path soon with comparative ease, he 
will find it difficult to reach the third path for a long 
time. The reason is that both of the attainers of the first 
path and the second path are well practiced in the observ¬ 
ance of virtue (sila) or, in other words, they are the 
paragons of virtue. In the case of the attainer of the third 
path, he must have also fully developed concentration 


51 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


(samadhi). Therefore, he is not able to attain .the third 
path easily in that he has to strive hard to develop 
concentration. Be that as it may, without utmost effort 
to develop one’s powers, nobody can possibly know 
whether he is able to attain this path or that path. In 
some cases, the attainment of a path comes only after a 
long time, and because one has to strive that long it must 
not be assumed that one has not yet fully developed 
paramitas. Again, the present effort can lead to the fulfil¬ 
ment of paramitas , getting nearer to maturity. So, one 
should not waste one’s time by weighing in his mind the 
matter of one’s having the paramitas or not. 

The meditator should bear in mind the following unde¬ 
niable point and put forth utmost effort to achieve his 
aspiration. 

Even the development of paramitas is not possible with¬ 
out effort. Granted that one has fully developed para¬ 
mitas, he cannot possibly attain any path without effort. 
Such a person can attain a path easily and speedily if he 
puts forth effort. If he has developed paramitas to an 
appreciable extent, his effort will lead to its maturity and 
consequently he can attain the path he aspires to. At the 
least, he has sown potent seeds for the harvest of a path 
in the next existence. 


Advice 

In these times those who are most ardent and keen to 
work for their own deliverance from the ills of the world 
and the attainment of magga-phala-nirvana, which is the 
highest goal of vipassana (insight) meditation, they will 
be well advised to practice by the aforesaid way the 
contemplations of body, feeling, consciousness and men¬ 
tal objects, called otherwise satipatthana meditation. It is, 
in fact, a “must” for them. 

A Special Note 

The technique of insight meditation outlined in this 
treatise is quite sufficient for persons of fair intelligence. 
Such persons, having read it, should practice these con- 


52 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


temptations with firm faith, keen desire and great dili¬ 
gence, in a methodical manner, and they can be sure of 
progress. It must, however, be pointed out that the 
details of the experiences and the progressive stages of 
insight gone through by meditators cannot possibly be 
described in full in this short treatise. There still remains 
much that is worthy of description. On the other hand, 
what has been described here is not experienced in toto 
by every meditator. There are bound to be differences 
according to one’s capabilities and paramitas. Again, 
one’s faith, desire and diligence do not remain constant 
always. Furthermore, a meditator, having no instructor 
and being entirely dependent on book knowledge, will be 
as cautious and hesitant as a traveler who has never been 
on a particular journey. Therefore, it is obviously not 
very easy for such a person to attain the paths, fruitions 
and nirvana (magga-phala-nirvana) if he goes on striving 
without a teacher to guide and encourage him. This being 
so, one who is really keen to meditate until he attains his 
goal, magga-phala-nirvana, must find out a teacher who is 
fully qualified by his own attainments to guide him all 
along the way from the lowest stage of insight to the 
highest knowledges of path, fruition and reviewing. This 
advice is quite in accord with what is stated in the Nidana 
Vagga, Sumyutta Nikaya: “A teacher should be sought 
for knowledge about decay and death as it really is.” 
Should anybody be obsessed with pride—“I am an extra¬ 
ordinary man. Why should I learn from anyone?”—he will 
be well advised to do away with such pride, as Potthila 
Mahathera did. 

In the course of contemplation, bearing in mind the 
following advice of the Buddha, one should go all out to 
win the goal. 

No slacker nor the man of puny strength 
May win nirvana, freedom from all ill. 

And this young brother, yea, this peerless man 
Bears the last burden, Mara’s conqueror.

Notes 

1. The eight Uposatha precepts are: abstention from 
(1) killing, (2) stealing, (3) all sexual intercourse, 
(4) lying, (5) intoxicants, (6) partaking of solid food 
and certain liquids after twelve o’clock noon, 

(7) dance, song, music, shows (attendance and per¬ 
formance), the use of perfumes, ornaments, etc., and 

(8) luxurious beds. 

2. There are four noble individuals (ariya-puggala). 
They are those who have obtained a state of 
sanctity: 

a. The stream-winner (sotapanna) is one who has 
become free from the first three of the ten 
fetters which bind him to the sensuous sphere, 
namely, personality belief, skeptical doubt, and 
attachment to mere rules and rituals. 

b. The once-returner (sakadagami) has weakened 
the fourth and fifth of the ten fetters, sensuous 
craving and ill will. 

c. The nonreturner (anagami) becomes fully free 
from the above-mentioned five lower fetters and 
is no longer reborn in the sensuous sphere before 
reaching nirvana. 

d. Through the path of holiness one further 
becomes free of the last five fetters: craving for 
fine material existence (in celestial worlds), crav¬ 
ing for immaterial (purely mental) existence, 
conceit, restlessness, ignorance. 

3. The thirty-two parts of the body, as used in body 
contemplation, are: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, 
skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, 
liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, 
stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, 
lymph, tears, serum, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial 
fluid, urine, brain. 

4. Some of these points where the touch sensation may 
be observed are: where thigh and knee touch, or the 
hands placed together, or finger to finger, thumb to 


54 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


thumb, closing of the eyelids, tongue inside the 
mouth, lips touching when mouth is closed. 

5. Taruna-udayabbaya-nana. On the degrees of insight 
knowledge, see The Progress of Insight by The Ven. 
Mahasi Sayadaw (publ. by The Forest Hermitage, 
Kandy, Ceylon). 

6. The preceding section describes the “analytical 
knowledge of body and mind” (nama-rupa- 
pariccheda-nana), belonging to the “Purification of 
View.” 

7. The preceding section refers to “knowledge by dis¬ 
cerning conditionality” (paccaya-pariggaha-nana), 
belonging to the “Purification by Overcoming 
Doubt.” 

8. The preceding paragraphs refer to the “knowledge of 
comprehension.” 

9. These phenomena are the “ten corruptions of in¬ 
sight.” They have the character of “corruptions” 
only when they cause attachment in the meditator, 
or lead to conceit, i.e., if, in misjudging these phe¬ 
nomena and overrating his achievements, he believes 
to have attained to the paths of sainthood. These 
“corruptions” occur at the stage of “weak know¬ 
ledge of rise and fall.” 

10. This refers to “purification by knowledge and wis¬ 
dom of what is path and not-path.” 

11. Reference is here to the “final knowledge of rise and 
fall.” 

12. “Knowledge of dissolution.” 

13. “Knowledge of fearfulness.” 

14. “Knowledge of misery.” 

15. “Knowledge of disgust.” 

16. “Knowledge of desire for deliverance.” 

17. There are ten characteristics of impermanence, 
twenty-five of suffering and five of no-self. 

18. This refers to “knowledge of re-observation (or 
reflection).” 

19. At the suggestion of the Venerable Author, the fol¬ 
lowing two references are here quoted, in explana- 


55

tion of the stages in the realization of nirvana, on the 
paths of stream-entry, once-returning, etc.: 

a. ‘“One who sees nirvana, which merges in the 
deathless (in the sense of the end) realizes it. . . 

“The seeing of nirvana, at the moment of the 
first path is realizing as seeing (dassana). At the 
other path moments it is realizing as developing 
(bhavana). ” 

b. “. . . Suppose a man who can see is travel¬ 
ing along a path on a cloudy night. The path is 
obscured by the darkness. Lightning flashes and 
dispels the dark. In the absence of darkness the 
path becomes clear. This happens on a second 
journey, and again on a third journey. Here, like 
the man who can see his setting out on the path, 
is the effort of insight put forth by the disciple 
for the stream-winning path. Like the oblitera¬ 
tion of the way in darkness is the darkness 
covering the truths. Like the moment when the 
lightning flashes and dispels the darkness is the 
moment when the light of the stream-winning 
path arises and dispels the darkness covering the 
truths. Like the manifestation of the way when 
darkness clears is the time of the manifestations 
of the four truths to the stream-winning path; 
and what is manifest in the path is even manifest 
to the person who has got it. Like the second 
journey is the effort of insight to get the once- 
returning path. . . . Like the third journey is the 
effort of insight to get the never-returning 
path . . . .”

APPENDIX 

Following is a concise excerpted translation from the 
Pali of the Maha Satipatthana Sutra accompanied by a 
commentary from the author, Mahasi Sayadaw. This is 
offered as an expanded aid in this meditational tech¬ 
nique, a reference to the source from which all Sati¬ 
patthana meditations arose, the words of the Buddha. 

Techniques of Meditation 

The Maha Satipatthana Sutra states: 

• “And moreover, bhikkhus , a brother, when he 
is walking, is aware of it thus: ‘I walk’; or when 
he is standing, or sitting, or lying down, he is 
aware thereof.” 

• “And moreover, bhikkhus, a brother, whether 
he departs, or returns, whether he looks at or 
looks away from, whether he has drawn in or 
stretched out (his limbs), whether he has donned 
underrobe, overrobe, or bowl, whether he is 
eating, drinking, chewing, savoring, or whether 
he is obeying the calls of nature—is aware of 
what he is about. In going, standing, sitting, 
sleeping, watching, talking, or keeping silence, 
he knows what he is doing.” 

• “And moreover, bhikkhus, a brother reflects 
upon this very body, however it be placed or 
disposed, with respect to its fundamentals [i.e., 
the four elements].” 

• “Herein, 0 bhikkhus, is a brother when affected 
by a feeling of pleasure, aware of it, reflecting, ‘I 
feel a pleasurable feeling.’ So, too, is he aware 
when affected by a painful feeling.” 

“Herein, 0 bhikkhus, a brother, if his thought 
be lustful, is aware that it is so, or his thought be 
free from lust, is aware that it is so.” 

• “Herein, O bhikkhus, a brother when within him 
is sensuous desire, is aware of it, reflecting, ‘I 


57 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


have within me sensuous desire.’” 

In consonance with these teachings of the Buddha, it 
has been stated in colloquial language thus: “rising” while 
the abdomen is rising; “falling” while the abdomen is 
falling; “bending” while the limbs are bending; “stretch¬ 
ing” while the limbs are stretching; “wandering” while 
the mind is wandering; “thinking, reflecting,” or “know¬ 
ing” while one is so engaged; “feeling stiff, hot,” or “in 
pain” while one feels so; “walking, standing, sitting,” or 
“lying” while one is so placed. 

Here it should be noted that walking and so on are 
stated in common words instead of “being aware of the 
inner wind element manifesting itself in the movement of 
the limbs,” as is stated in the Pali texts. 

Rising and Falling Movement of the Abdomen 
It is quite in agreement with the Buddha’s teachings 
to contemplate on the rising and falling movement of the 
abdomen. Such rising and falling is a physical process 
(rupa) caused by the pressure of the wind element. The 
wind element is comprised in the corporeality group of 
the five aspects of the physical and mental phenomena of 
existence (khandha)', in the tactile object of the twelve 
bases fayatana)\ in the body impression of the eighteen 
elements (dhatu)\ in the wind element of the four mater¬ 
ial elements (mahd-bhuta)\ in the truth of suffering of the 
four noble truths (sacca)-, corporeality group, a tactile 
object, a body impression and truth of suffering are 
certainly objects for insight contemplation. Surely they 
are not otherwise. The rising and falling movement of the 
abdomen is therefore a proper object for contemplation, 
and while so contemplating, being aware that it is but a 
movement of the wind element, subject to the laws of 
impermanence, suffering and unsubstantiality, is quite in 
agreement with the Buddha’s discourses on khandhas, 
ayatanas, dhatus and saccas. 

While the abdomen is rising and falling the pressure 
and movement experienced thereby is a manifestation of 
the wind element which is tactile, and perceiving that 


58 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


rightly as such is quite in consonance with what the 
Buddha taught as briefly shown below. 

• “Do ye apply your mind thoroughly, brethren, 
to body and regard it in its true nature as imper¬ 
manent.” 

• “Brethren, when a brother sees the body which 
is impermanent, as impermanent, this view of his 
is the right view.” 

• “Herein, 0 bhikkhus, a brother reflects: ‘Such is 
material form, such is its genesis, such its passing 
away.’” 

• “Do ye apply your minds thoroughly, brethren, 
to the tactile objects and regard their true nature 
as impermanent.” 

• “Brethren, when a brother sees tactile objects 
which are impermanent, this view of his is the 
right view.” 

• “But by fully knowing, by comprehending, by 
detaching himself from, by abandoning the tac¬ 
tile objects, one is capable of extinguishing ill.” 

• “In him that knows and sees tactile objects as 
impermanent, ignorance vanishes and knowledge 
arises.” 

• “Herein, 0 bhikkhus, a brother is aware of the 
organs of touch and tangibles.” 

• “Whatever is an internal element of motion, and 
whatever is an external element of motion, just 
these are the element of motion. By means of 
perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this 
as it really is, thus: This is not mine, this I am 
not, this is not my self.” 

Thus it will be seen that the contemplation of the 
rising and the falling movement of the abdomen is in 
accord with the above discourses and also with the Maha- 
satipatthana Sutra (Dhatumanasikara Pabba ~Attention 
to Elements). 

Again, the wind element that causes the movement 
and pressure of the abdomen, comprised in the corporeal¬ 
ity group, is the truth of suffering. 


59 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


“And what, monks, is the truth about ill? Ill, it 
should be said, is the fivefold factor of grasp¬ 
ing.” 

“Monks, ill, as a truth, is to be fully under¬ 
stood.” 


Starting with Materiality 

An insight meditator should start with materiality, 

which is more easily discernible than mentality. 

• “But one whose vehicle is insight discerns the 
four elements.” 

• “And as regards those phenomena that are 
amenable to comprehension a beginning should 
be made by comprehending those among them 
that are obvious and easily discernible by the 
individual [meditator].” 

• “Insight meditation begins with what is discern¬ 
ible. So a beginning should be made by compre¬ 
hending those that are discernible. But later 
what is not easily discernible must somehow be 
made discernible and comprehended.” 

Depending also on the aforesaid commentarial and 
subcommentarial statements, instructions are given to the 
meditators to begin with the rising and falling movement 
of the abdomen with a view to facilitating their medita¬ 
tion. However, when concentration has been developed, 
contemplation should be made on whatever arises at all 
the six sense doors. Instructions to this effect are also 
given to the meditators. As instructed, the meditators can 
very well carry on with their contemplation. Therefore, 
no doubt should be entertained whether it will be suffi¬ 
cient to contemplate only on the rising and falling move¬ 
ment of the abdomen. 

Contemplation on the Arising at the Six Sense Doors 

Although contemplation must be made on whatever 
arises at all the sense doors, it must not be accompanied 
by thoughts about it. Only bare attention is to be paid to 
what arises at one or the other of the six sense doors. 


60 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


• “ He who for things he sees no passion breeds, 

But mindful, clear of head, can suffer sense, 

With uninflamed heart, nor staying clings.” 

• “He who for things he hears, or smells, or tastes, 

Or for things touched and felt no passion breeds, 
But mindful, clear of head, can suffer sense, 

With uninflamed heart, nor staying clings.” 

Contemplating on the rising and falling of the abdo¬ 
men, one who knows its pressure and movement is “he 
who for things he felt no passion breeds, but mindful, 
clear of head, can suffer sense.” 

• “Brethren, the all is to be fully known. What all, 
brethren, is to be fully known? The eye, breth¬ 
ren, is to be fully known, visual objects are to be 
fully known, eye consciousness is to be fully 
known, eye contact is to be fully known, that 
weal or woe or neutral state experienced, which 
arises owing to eye contact—that also is to be 
fully known. Ear is to be fully known, sounds 
are to be fully known . .. nose . . . scent . . . 
tongue ... savors . . . body is to be fully known, 
things tangible are to be fully known . . . mind is 
to be fully known, mind states are to be fully 
known. . . 

In the above passage “fully known” means the 
awareness of the material and mental arisings at the six 
sense doors. The awareness of the rising and falling move¬ 
ment of the abdomen is comprised in “things tangible are 
to be fully known.” 

• “Brethren, the eye is to be comprehended, visual 
objects are to be comprehended, body is to be 
comprehended, things tangible are to be compre¬ 
hended, mind is to be comprehended, mind 
states are to be comprehended.” 

Insight Meditations Without Prior Jhana Development. 

It is possible to begin straightaway with insight 
(vipassana) meditation without having previously devel¬ 
oped full concentration in knowledge (jhana) meditation. 


61 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


• “Herein, some persons contemplate on the five 
aggregates of clinging as impermanent and so on 
without having previously developed tranquility. 
This contemplation is insight meditation.” 

This commentarial statement shows that it is possible 
to start with insight meditation without having striven to 
achieve access and full concentration. It has been stated 
that one whose vehicle is insight discerns four elements, 
which also goes to show this possibility. Besides, of the 
twenty-one parts of Mahasatipatthana Sutra, all except 
those dealing with mindfulness of breathing, the reflec¬ 
tion on the repulsiveness of the body and the nine ceme¬ 
tery contemplations, show the manner of insight medita¬ 
tion, and so it is obvious that insight meditation is 
possible thereby. However, as the Commentary observes 
that these parts deal with access concentration contem¬ 
plations, it should be understood that access concentra¬ 
tion is developed while contemplating on the postures of 
the body and so on and, having overcome the five hin¬ 
drances, purity of mind is attained. Therefore, of the said 
parts, Visuddhimagga treats the reflection of the material 
elements concerned with insight meditation, under the 
heading of a meditation subject called “discerning the 
elements” (dhatu-vavatthana) and points out that, while 
contemplating the four elements, the hindrances are over¬ 
come and access concentration is attained. On the 
strength of this commentarial statement, it should be 
borne in mind with confidence and firmness that while 
contemplating on either all the four or on one, two or 
three of the four, access concentration can be developed, 
the hindrances overcome and purity of mind attained. It 
is the personal experience of those who practice medita¬ 
tion ardently. 

Attainment of Purity of Mind by Access Concentration 

• “Purity of mind is the twofold concentration of 
the accessory and the ecstatic stage.” 

• “The purification of consciousness, namely, the 
eight attainments, together with access concen- 


62 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


tration. . . .” 

• “Access concentration being like full concentra¬ 
tion, the base of insight meditation is as well 
purity of mind. That is why the commentator 
states ‘together with access concentration.’” 

• “When ordinary people and trainers develop it, 
thinking, ‘After emerging from one of the eight 
meditative attainments we shall exercise insight 
with concentrated consciousness,’ the develop¬ 
ment of absorption concentration provides them 
with the benefit of insight by serving as the 
proximate cause of insight, and so too does 
access concentration as method of arriving at 
wide open (conditions) in crowded (circum¬ 
stances.” 

• “As a method of arriving at ‘wide open’ means 
as a method of getting an opportunity, the ninth 
opportunity (the lifetime of the Buddha) for the 
benefit (of attainment of the path, fruition and 
nirvana). To elaborate: as it is very difficult to 
come across the dispensation of a buddha, a 
person, terror-stricken, is so very eager to gain 
deliverance from samsara that he, without await¬ 
ing the attainment of full concentration, begins 
insight meditation, basing it only on access con¬ 
centration.” 

These two passages show most clearly that purity of 
mind can be attained also by access concentration, and 
insight meditation is possible thereby. 

• “The five grasping groups ... are the conditions 
which should be pondered with method by a 
virtuous brother, as being impermanent, suffer¬ 
ing, sick, as an impostor, as a dart, as pain, as ill 
health, as alien, as transitory, empty and soul¬ 
less. 

“By a brother who is a stream-winner ... it 
is the same five groups of grasping that should 
be so pondered. 

“By one who is a once-retumer ... so pon- 


63 



http://www.dhammadownload.com 


dered. 

“By one who is a nonreturner ... so pon¬ 
dered . 

“Indeed, friend, it is possible for a virtuous 
brother so pondering with method these five 
groups of grasping to realize the fruits of stream¬ 
winning; for a brother who is a stream-winner 
... to realize the fruits of once-returning: for a 
brother who is a once-returner ... to realize the 
fruits of nonreturning; and for a brother who is 
a nonreturner ... to realize the fruits of arahat- 
ship.” 

This discourse on virtue shows clearly that one who 
is virtuous can ponder the five grasping groups and, by so 
pondering, realize, by stages, the fruits of stream-winning, 
once-returning, nonreturning and arahatship. The rising 
and falling movement of the abdomen is the wind ele¬ 
ment comprised in the corporeality group. So it should 
be borne in mind steadfastly that the technique of medi¬ 
tation based on the rising and falling movement of the 
abdomen and the contemplation of five grasping groups 
that arise at the six sense doors is proper and right, leading 
up to the realization of the fruits of arahatship. 

In conclusion, special attention may be drawn to the 
fact that it is quite proper to contemplate on whatever is 
of material nature in any part of the body, and that it is 
equally proper to contemplate on whatever is of wind 
element in any part of the body.
