Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python, one of the major programming languages on and off the web. The Python community refers to him as the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), a title seemingly from a Monty Python skit.

He moved from the Netherlands to the USA in 1995, where he met his wife. Until July 2003 they lived in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC with their son Orlijn, who was born in 2001. They then moved to Silicon Valley where Guido worked for for a variety of companies including Google and Dropbox (spending 50% of his time on Python!).

Guido's home on the web is http://www.python.org/~guido/.
